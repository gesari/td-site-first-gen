        Thanks for checking out the first iteration of my digital Dreamscape tools! This landing page will direct you to different parts of the setting I've worked on thus far. Hopefully the labels for the different parts of the site are self-explanatory, but if you're unsure where to begin, I'd say start with the Primer and go from there: its information will be relevant to both contextualize the game rules for Thymoran Dreams and serve to impart a basic understanding of the things that underpin the Dreamscape setting itself.

        This is, of course, very much a work in progress. Any feedback you're willing to take the time to provide is much appreciated!
