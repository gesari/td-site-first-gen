        <div class="localContent">
            <h2 class="localHead">Attributes</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">Unlike Statistics, a character's Attributes confer bonuses that are generally not numerical. Most of them are very open-ended, as their purpose is primarily to provide mechanics which confirm the story a Player is trying to roleplay with a character.</p>
            <p class="localHeadBody">The purpose of Attributes is primarily to interact with Lucidity tokens generated via checks and awarded during play. Most PCs will have ideas about their character's proficiencies and ties to the game space, and Attributes are meant to provide a way to confirm those beliefs. The invocation of Lucidity Tokens is meant to facilitate a PC's success when executing actions Players know a character to be good at while also providing a way for Players to know what those things are in the first place.</p>

            <!-- Attunements -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="attunement">Attunement</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">There are seven attunements, corresponding to the seven facets of the Dreamscape. Dreamers, regardless of their parents' origins, are typically born as a humanoid and then undergo physical changes in accordance with their individual attunement as they reach maturity. The process continues as they grow over the course of their lives.  A character's Attunement affects not only how they appear, but also how their magic manifests when Free-casting: a Catalytic’s spells will naturally take on a fiery quality unless purposefully altered, whereas an Spatial’s energy may represent the lightning discharged in gas clouds. </p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Free-casting spells which interact specifically with their attunement's facet grants the dreamer a bonus equal to their Spell Tier to the Polarity of both dice pools. Alternatively, a Lucidity Token can be invoked for any spell this bonus would apply to.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="catalytic">Catalytic</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Change, associated with fire, birth, death, and transmutation magic. Passionate, driven, and often self-motivated, Catalytic dreamers often have a cause and are ready to see it through. They prefer dynamic environments, but whether that's a leading role in the Legion, the smooth operation of an Optio, or the rush of gladiatorial combat is entirely up to the individual.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers with a Catalytic attunement have the ability to traverse fiery surfaces or interact with very high temperatures without being negatively affected. When moving through fiery or molten terrain, a Catalytic dreamer can move to any other point of continuous fire as a single unit of Movement.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="fluid">Fluid</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Flow, most commonly associated with azai, the interstellar Flow, and conduction and harmonic magics. Though they may not intend to, Fluid dreamers often tend to treat life as a grand adventure in which the journey, not the destination, is the primary focus. Though there is a perhaps earned stereotype for their affinity to coastal regions, they are just as likely to settle roots somewhere that brings them peace as they are to live a life of traveling.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers with a Fluid attunement have the ability to traverse watery surfaces and underwater with ease, and have no issues breathing underwater or any other liquid.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="luminal">Luminal</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Light: all occurrences leave behind a trace. Light, echoes, records, stories, augury magic, and the Reliquary are aligned with this attunement. Luminal dreamers are easily identified for the unique bioluminescent patterns on their skin, which often seem to shift and flow under close inspection. They make enthralling visual artists and lecturers, but are just as often happy to be hidden away in a quiet corner of an archive.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Luminal dreamers have patterns of light that appear on their skin and which they are able to change at will. This ability gives them access to the Mesmerise Skill.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="organic">Organic</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of organized Growth. Associated with animist magics, the emergent miracles of life and consciousness, and the natural changes that occur in the dream as a result of this. Organic attuned dreamers live for cultivation, whether it be collecting trinkets, growing things, or helping others, and they typically exude an aura of calm. As a result, they are often regarded with easy trust; even, and sometimes especially, including wildlife.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">While all dreamers have remarkable regenerative properties thanks to their body's ability to absorb and synthesize azai, those with the Organic attunement are particularly gifted in this area. In addition to being able to communicate with the flora and fauna of the dream, Organic dreamers regain half their maximum Vitality whenever they are able to execute a Short Rest.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="spatial">Spatial</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Space: the stage upon which the Dreamscape is set. Often associated with air, wide open space, the Interstice, and translocation magics. Visionary attuned dreamers often find themselves unbound by gravity, developing access to flight naturally as they age. Energetic and flighty, they feel most at home in wide open spaces, scenic vistas, and anywhere they've yet to explore.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers with a Spatial attunement have an uncanny ability for recycling air through their body without needing to breathe, allowing them to hold it for a near-indefinite period of time. They are also especially adept at moving through space: they learn the Buoy spell immediately, and Flight immediately upon meeting the prerequisites.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="static">Static</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Stasis. Most commonly associated with azon, occlusion magics, and the physical world. Static-attuned dreamers often have tough skin, but whether this manifests as a thick hide or as semi-fluid rock or metal or somewhere in between will vary from person to person. They often feel comfortable in enclosed spaces, or on or under solid ground, which, for many of them, proves as easy to move through as air.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers with a Static attunement are able to traverse solid materials that have not been warded against entry, and may guide others so long as they maintain a physical connection. Doing so somehow causes no complications with respiration.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="visionary">Visionary</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Possibility: things that have been or could come to pass. Associated with the Oracle, dreams, perception and enchantment magics. Natural shapeshifters, Visionary attuned dreamers are uniquely capable of experiencing the world from varied vantage points. Though most eventually sculpt a preferred appearance for themselves, it is also not unusual for visionaries to alter their visage in a manner akin to changing clothes.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers with a Visionary attunement have a strong affinity for the Oracle, which has given their physical form a certain level of malleability. They may alter their physical form as an action at any time and in any way they so choose while retaining the same mass.</p>

            <!-- Touchstone -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="touchstone">Touchstone</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">A character's Touchstone is their ideal exemplar and as such is not limited to a finite list of choices. Touchstones are archetypes, defining moments, obsessions, and embodied identities. They are the first chance a Player has to confirm their ideas about who their PC is, what their opinions are, and how they make their choices.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A particularly vigilant civil servant might select Defender of the People, for instance, which might reflect their work as an investigator. Meanwhile, another PC may decide that their character is slightly impish or feels like a bit of a joker, and so they choose Animated Performer as theirs. Touchstones can also be tragic, however, such as the choice of Haunted Widow for a character searching for their husband's killer. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Quirk -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="quirk">Quirk</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">A quirk is meant to be a compounding factor on top of a character's Touchstone, and should ideally represent a habit they can't/won't break or a facet of their character that may be viewed as strange or off-putting by others. </p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A character's quirk might be a penchant for being overbearing about details and processes; as such, they may ruffle some feathers, but they are also incredibly likely to have a very organized space, to take well-documented notes, or to have a knack for breaking things down into manageable steps. Alternatively, a character might be a smoker, which could be frowned upon by those who don't like the smell, but also give the character inconspicuous access to knowledge and secrets via informal social interactions with other smokers. Quirks should not be debilitating (unless the player chooses to make them such), but rather add depth and complications to a character.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Unlike other Attributes, a PC's Quirk can be used to actively generate Lucidity Tokens if the PC allows the GM to use their Quirk to complicate a situation. In the case of the smoker above, they may go to speak to someone that has information they need. In such a circumstance, the GM might offer the PC a Lucidity Token if they agree that the NPC they're seeking information from will find the smell of their habit off putting, which might increase the difficulty modifier of any attempts to persuade them.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Traits -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="traits">Traits</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">A character's Traits are similar to their Touchstone and Quirk, in that they are open-ended statistics that are beyond the scope of choosing from a list of options. Unlike a character's Touchstone or Quirk, which serve to illuminate an inner truth about how a character experiences the world, their Traits are meant to symbolize their ties to it. More specifically (and practically), this will allow Players to begin to tie their character's stories both to the game space and each other. Traits are selected during character creation as a way for Players to begin to intermingle the stories of their PCs within the game space prior to play.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Generally, a Player will select the first Trait for their character as a continuation of their Touchstone and Quirk, and as a more concrete way of establishing them within the game space. Their second and third Traits, however, will be chosen in reaction to Traits chosen by other Players. There are many ways to achieve this, but an easy example of how to do so would simply be for each Player to write their first Trait down on a piece of paper or similar and for Players to then trade papers in successive stages, choosing Traits for themselves based on whatever was already written down by others. The purpose of this is to end up with a party of PCs that will already have connections to each other established prior to the Players interacting with each other at the start of play and to give them reasons why they might and should stick together.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Building on examples above, a character with the Touchstone Defender of the People and Quirk as a Smoker may choose their first trait to be Undercover Investigator. Other Players may, depending on their own choices, react to this Trait by choosing Criminal Informant as a Trait of their own. A third Player might then choose Getaway Pilot as one of their Traits in reaction to both of their counterparts. Each Trait affords each Player a distinct facet to their identity, and the way in which they are chosen allows Players to create connections and synergies between each other.</p>

            <!-- Invoking Attributes -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="invoking_attributes">Invoking Attributes</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">During play, Players will invariably come upon situations where a PC's Touchstone, Quirk, and/or Traits come into play. In these instances, a Player has two options: they may spend a Lucidity Token to automatically receive a Full Success degree on a related check, OR choose to roll the check an additional time, choosing the higher result. If they choose to roll the check and receive a Plus result, their Lucidity Token is not expended. This can happen at any time during play, so long as Players are in agreement.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Changing Attributes -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="changing_attributes">Changing Attributes</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Over the course of the game, Players may determine an Attribute they've chosen for a character is no longer a good fit. This can be because they're not getting as much use out of it as they'd like, it no longer fits with the themes of the game they're playing, if events in the game have changed the PC in some way, or for any other reason the Player feels warrants a change. In this case, Players may brainstorm as to what might serve as a better fit. The initial method of generating Traits is meant to help tie the PCs together in a tangible way, but Traits selected after character creation has finished have no such restrictions.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Attributes can be changed at any time, so long as both the GM and Player are on the same page with the terms of the change. Characters, just like people, have myriad facets to them. Attributes aren’t meant to showcase all of these things, just the ones a Player wishes to highlight. Changing a character’s Attributes is really just a matter of choosing a different aspect of them to bring to the fore.</p>
