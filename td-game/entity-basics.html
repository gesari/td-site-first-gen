    <div class="localContent">
        <!-- Page Content -->
        <h2 class="localHead">Entity Basics</h2>
        <p class="localHeadBody">This is the landing for the Dreamscape Setting. List of each link plus a small descriptor blurb.</p> 

        <!-- Entities -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="entities">Entities</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Entities are the operators within the game space whose actions the GM and PCs will be role-playing. While every entity has access to the same general actions, the bonuses they have towards succeeding in those actions will all be different based on several variables: their Statistics, Style, Attributes, Items, and their personal area of expertise denoted by their choice of Specialization. Players will have almost complete control over the customization of these variables.</p>

        <!-- Specializations -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="specializations">Specializations</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">While it is considered vital that dreamers have a comprehensive understanding of all nine subschools of azaian magic, Thymorans also believe in the virtue of specialization: that, through deep contemplation of a single facet of the dream, one might come to a greater understanding of its whole. Dreamers educated according to this tradition acquire a specialization, or spec, corresponding to both the subschool they have studied and the cultural traditions observed while doing so.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Every class has a unique binary tree of ten talent nodes (corresponding to ten levels) which they can traverse in any manner they choose. Characters receive the first talent in their tree when they select their Class, and may select a single talent to activate for every level they gain. </p>

        <!-- Alchemist -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="alchemist">Alchemist</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Transmutation Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Like those of the Dreamheart attunement, Alchemists are able to change their form at will. Unlike other shapeshifters, however, Alchemists are unique in their ability to alter the fundamental properties of their being. They receive a passive bonus to their Transmutation substat in addition to their training, which they are able to apply to other stats when they change their form, allowing for an incredible amount of versatility.</p>

        <!-- Arcanist -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="arcanist">Arcanist</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Conduction Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Arcanists train their astral bodies rigorously, which increases the range of their spells and allows them to tap into currents of the Azaian Flow, empowering them to conduct amounts of azai beyond what other dreamers could ever conceive. With enough training, they are able to use their own bodies as a point of confluence for multiple currents, effectively doubling their Potency and Secondary stats while they are able to maintain the effect.</p>

        <!-- Conduit -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="conduit">Conduit</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Harmonics Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Conduits have studied the regenerative cycles of the Dream and have learned the ways in which to function as a catalyst for the exchange of energies between the dimensions of the Oracle, the Dream, and the Reliquary. The energies they channel manifest in the surrounding environment as an Aura: creating an energizing effect on the Conduit and those near them.</p>

        <!-- Luminary -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="luminary">Luminary</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Perception Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Luminaries specialize in the use of Perception Projectors: custom engineered devices capable of projecting illusory effects and minor harmful effects. Combining their effects with a study of techniques to alter an entity's memory and sensory perception makes Luminaries peerless artists and infiltrators.</p>

        <!-- Operative -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="operative">Operative</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Enchantment Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Operatives are masters of technical magic, responsible for the design and crafting of most magical devices and arcanomatons. Every Operative has made custom modifications to their unitool, and while many of their changes will be unique, they all are sure to include capabilities for the production of a Swarm: imperceptibly small wisp constructs of pure magic that permeate the area within the Operative's spell range, and may even power their devices, such as defensive Turrets.</p>

        <!-- Phantom -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="phantom">Phantom</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Translocation Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Phantoms learn how to warp the fabric of the dream, allowing them to move (themselves and others) through space easier than other dreamers. They are able to trigger additional actions as part of their Plus results by bending space around them such that they act faster than others could ever hope to.</p>

        <!-- Sage -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="sage">Sage</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Augury Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">The Sage has, through study and meditation, begun to catch glimpses into the way the Dream may unfold before them, affording them the ability to react quickly to things before they happen. Drawing further on these talents allows them to help guide the course of present events by either foiling or enhancing the actions of other entities at the very moment they act.</p>

        <!-- Sentinel -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="sentinel">Sentinel</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Occlusion Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Sentinels bear the markings of their training upon their body in the form of glowing Runes: self-conjured azonian sigils which allow them to store pockets of azaian energies within themselves to be unleashed in tandem with their actions. Using these techniques, a Sentinel can turn themselves into a magical dynamo, unleashing surging forces as easily as creating unassailable barriers to lock down entire areas.</p>

        <!-- Spritist -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="spiritist">Spiritist</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Animism Specialist</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Through their study of the natural world and the forces that bind the disparate phenomena of the Dream together, Spiritists form a strong bond to the natural world, and especially the beings that inhabit it. Every Spiritist eventually finds companionship in an Avatar: an entity with whom they have soul bonded through loyalty, love, and magic. The pair operate as two bodies sharing a mind, amplifying each others' strength and that of those around them.</p>

        <!-- Statistics -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="statistics">Statistics</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">All characters start with a base 6 Vitality, 0 in all other statistics, and 5 points to invest as they choose into either primary stats or substat training. Each level after the first will grant a character 2 additional points to invest as they see fit to reflect the growth they’ve achieved during their journey. Investment into primary stats will increase a character’s acumen: they will become more potent, intelligent, and intuitive. Training in substats reflects time taken to learn new skills, and increases the number of tools at a character’s disposal via new spell architectures and free-casting bonuses.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Secondary Stats derive their base value from their associated Primary statistic. Each Primary statistic has two associated secondary stats: one which affects their physical capabilities, and one which affects their magic. Items, enchantments, and other effects will generally provide increases to Secondary statistics rather than Primary stats, however, so players may expect to see them with higher bonuses than their Primary counterparts.</p>

        <!-- Primary Stats -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="primary_stats">Primary Stats</h4>

        <!-- Vitality -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Vitality</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A relatively straightforward statistic. A character's max Vitality is equal to their Vitality stat value. Unlike other Primary statistics, Vitality has no Secondary stats associated with it and increases by 1 per level regardless of stat investment.</p>

        <!-- Cognition -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Cognition</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A character's mental acumen. A marker of how well they employ reason and assimilate knowledge.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Associated Secondary Stats: Recovery, Adaptation</p>

        <!-- Force -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Force</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A character's physical prowess. A representation of how in tune they are to their own physical movements, and their ability to affect the Dream around them.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Associated Secondary Stats: Attack, Projection</p>

        <!-- Insight -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Insight</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A character's ability to perceive the world around them, intuit the actions of others, and synergize the actions of their mind and body.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Associated Secondary Stats: Defense, Unification</p>

        <!-- Substats -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="substats">Substats</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">There are nine substats which correlate to the nine subschool of magic. There are a finite amount of training points a character can invest in any substat at any point in time: each substat bonus caps at 4, and each point allocated beyond the first requires a character to have attained a certain level before they may be trained.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Training in a substat gives a character access to their d6 pool to augment affected checks, as well as knowledge of 2 spell architectures from within that school per point of investment. By default, a character is granted free training in the substat relating to their chosen class, conferred automatically upon meeting the level threshold requirements for the training.</p>

        <!-- Style -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="style">Style</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">A character's choice of style will govern the ways in which they employ magic: the Potency of their spells, the range at which they are effective, the status effects they can inflict, and unique traits and abilities.</p>

        <!-- Assertive Style -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Assertive Style</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A close range, methodical style centered around precise, high Potency executions that build upon each other.</p>

        <!-- Astral Style -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Astral Style</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A unique style that involves wielding one's focus with their astral limbs, allowing them to act from two positions simultaneously.</p>

        <!-- Fluid Style -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Fluid Style</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A versatile mid-range style that focuses on patient, fluid techniques.</p>

        <!-- Lightning Style -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Lightning Style</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A fast paced mid-range style that focuses on approaching solutions from multiple avenues.</p>

        <!-- Precision Style -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Precision Style</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">A long range style focused around careful observation and calculated applications of force.</p>

        <!-- Potency -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="potency">Potency</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">A character's base Potency is derived from their choice of Style. Every other ability they use or spell they cast is subject to, and scales with, their Potency. Potency values apply fully on a Full Success, and are halved on a Partial Success; for this reason, base Potency values are always even numbers.</p>

        <!-- Attributes -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="attributes">Attributes</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Unlike Statistics, a character's Attributes confer bonuses that are generally not numerical. Most of them are very open-ended, as their purpose is primarily to provide mechanics which confirm the story a Player is trying to roleplay with a character.</p>

        <!-- Attunement -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="attunement">Attunement</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers, regardless of their parents' origins, undergo physical changes in accordance with their individual attunement as they reach maturity: a process which continues as they grow over the course of their lives. A character's Attunement affects not only how they appear, but also how their magic manifests: a Fireheart's spells might naturally take on a fiery quality unless purposefully altered, whereas an Airheart's energy may represent the lightning discharged in storm clouds.</p>

        <!-- Airheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Airheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Airheart dreamers are specifically in tune with the air and empty spaces of the dream, giving them proficiency in spells relating to these areas. They have an innate ability to fly, and can hold their breath for as long as they choose.</p>

        <!-- Dreamheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Dreamheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Dreamheart dreamers are especially aligned with the dimension of possibilities: the Oracle. They are proficient with spells that augment an object's existing physical properties, and have the ability to shapeshift.</p>

        <!-- Fireheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Fireheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Fireheart dreamers have specific acumen with spells that deal with fire or the concentration and release of energy. They are able to withstand and safely conduct large amounts of energy through their body without being harmed.</p>

        <!-- Lightheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Lightheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Lightheart dreamers have a relationship with light and its presence and absence within the Dream; they have a bonus to spells interacting with these forces. They may use these powers to comfort and mesmerise others.</p>

        <!-- Stoneheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Stoneheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Stoneheart dreamers have specific acumen with spells regarding solid matter and the physical world. They have the ability to move through unwarded walls and other solid surfaces.</p>

        <!-- Sylvanheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Sylvanheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Sylvanheart dreamers are especially proficient with spells involving life and other emergent processes. They have enhanced natural regeneration and the ability to use their telepathy to commune with all living beings rather than just dreamers.</p>

        <!-- Waterheart -->
        <p class="sectionSubHead">Waterheart Attunement</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Waterheart dreamers have specific acumen with spells controlling matter in its liquid state. They have an innate ability to tread upon or traverse any liquid.</p>

        <!-- Touchstone -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="touchstone">Touchstone</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">This is the fundamental idea that either defines or drives a character. Whether this is something they consciously know, or if it is simply something to inform their PC’s own understanding of them is an individual determination each PC can make for themself. This is not a choice that is restricted to a finite list, and is not tied to any statistical benefits for the character. However, when used creatively, they can be used to give PCs an edge when invoked via a Lucidity token.</p>

        <p class="exampleText">Dalyny’s Player determines she is a very physically active individual who, due to her minute stature, would never be able to be the strongest or fastest of her peers. Instead, she has sought to become the most capable, and has spent years training as a performing artist with members of her community. Her dynamic training has developed strength through excessive ranges of motion, rendering Dalyny capable of feats many others lack the core strength, coordination, or are simply too big to accomplish, and is especially versed in being vaulted into the air by a strong partner. With a solid idea for their character in mind, Dalyny’s Player chooses Acrobat as her Touchstone.</p>

        <!-- Quirk -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="quirk">Quirk</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">As with a character's Touchstone, their quirk is an open-ended, non-statistical determination, but they should be something that can cause complications for the character in the right circumstances, and afford them unique insight in others. These aren't meant to be debilitating, but to further contextualize the character in the minds of both their Player and the rest of the group. A Quirk like “Social Smoker” could definitely be a problem if they’re planning for some serious physical exertion, but in others it could be a definitive benefit for easing social tension.</p>

        <p class="exampleText">Because much of Dalyny's training involved coordinated, choreographed performances with a team, most of her goals for training have been derived from the needs of a group: if a performance involved fitting into smaller spaces, she might train contortion; if it involved being vaulted through the air, she might practice landing smoothly from a fall. Even though she would pursue her goals with a single-minded determination once she had one, she always had trouble picking a direction of her own. Dalyny's Player chooses Team Reliant as her Quirk to represent her strong preference for interdependence within a group to individual self-sufficiency.</p>

        <!-- Traits -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="traits">Traits</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">A character's traits are similar to their Touchstone and Quirk, in that they are beyond the scope of choosing from a list of options. Unlike a character's Touchstone or Quirk, which serve to illuminate an inner truth about how a character experiences the world, their Traits are meant to symbolize their ties to it. More specifically (and practically), this will allow Players to begin to tie their character's stories both to the game space and each other. </p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Traits are generated as part of a group activity during character creation as a way for Players to begin to intertwine the stories of their PCs within the game space prior to play.</p>

        <!-- Invoking Attributes -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="invoking_attributes">Invoking Attributes</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">During play, Players will invariably come upon situations where their attributes come into play. In these instances, a Player may spend a Lucidity Token to automatically receive a Full Success degree on a related check, or receive a situational bonus as determined by the GM.</p>

        <!-- Changing Traits -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="changing_traits">Changing Traits</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Attributes are meant to expose only *some* of the facets of a character, and sometimes it can be best to focus on others. They can be changed at any time, so long as all Players involved are on the same page with the terms of the change.</p>

        <!-- Items and Equipment -->
        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="items_equipment">Items and Equipment</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">There are four different types of equipment that characters will be concerned with: their focus, their unitool, talismans, and arcanetics.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">Every character will begin with at least a focus and unitool in their possession, as these are considered central to life within the Dream by society at large and provided to all free of charge.</p>

        <!-- Focus -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="focus">Focus</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Characters have a single focus which serves to facilitate their spellcasting, similar to how you may expect a wizard in other settings to always have a wand or staff.</p>

        <!-- Unitools -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="unitool">Unitool</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">After a dreamer's focus, nothing is so indispensable to them as their universal tool. Traditionally worn or implanted as a bracelet on either wrist, it has several standard functions: it acts as a communication device, allowing telepathic communication between users across vast distances; it acts as an information retrieval and storage device, capable of projecting holographic displays of data; it allows the user to interact with all magical technologies; it modulates a dreamer's reserves of azai, creating a protective Shield around them; it can store and implement certain spell architectures, even if the user has not yet learned the spell themselves.</p>

        <!-- Talismans / Arcanetics -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="talismans_arcanetics">Talismans and Arcanetics</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Talismans and Sigils are similar in function, but not necessarily in form. Talismans are freely traded magical items which are rendered inert when not attuned to a specific dreamer. Arcanetics, however, is a catchall term for implanted sigils and enchanted prosthetic limbs which cannot be deactivated or removed once endowed.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">While dreamers may have as many talismans as they wish to accumulate and carry, they are limited in how many active talismans and/or arcanetics they may benefit from simultaneously, with a cap equal to their current Spell Tier.</p>

        <!-- Acquiring New Items -->
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead" id="acquiring_items">Acquiring New Items</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Talismans are plentiful throughout the Dream and can be found in many places, either out on adventures or in the shops of Courts and Guilds that Players may interact with. Arcanetic implantation typically requires a specialist, but they are likewise popular amongst the various organizations of the Dream. If PCs are so inclined, they may also train to become artisans themselves.</p>
