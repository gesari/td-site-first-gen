        <h2 class="localHead">Placing Your Character</h2>
        <p class="localHeadBody">Now that you have some context for the setting, we can begin exploring the ways in which your character will interact with it. When making a character, keep these following points in mind.</p> 

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="names">Names</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">There are many ways in which Dreamers will refer to themselves: Taken names (first names), Given names ("last" names), and Communal names (derived both from their community and their place within it). There are specific traditions concerning each type of name, but in general you can begin to engage with them as though you were picking a first and last name for your character. Taken names are always chosen in much the same way you choose a character's first name, in that they are something the entity themself prefers to be called. Given names are usually one or two compounded words which have the appearance of a last name: Sterling, Willowind, Silentheart, Cobalt. Communal names are less chosen and simply a product of who and where you are, generally derived from the Court of which you are a citizen, and will require less work on the part of the Player at first, unless they specifically wish it.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="attunements">Attunements</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">The dream has many facets, and almost every dreamer is attuned to one of them. This is something an entity is born with and generally does not change over time, but instead serves as an important factor in their growth. Attunements are not inherited or generally culturally specific; their occurrence among the populace is generally uniform across realms. Because attunements influence so much of a dreamer's growth, this can have a profound impact on their physical development. Though dreamers generally born bearing resemblances to their parents, they may often change dramatically over the course of their life based on their attunement.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="dreamer_lifecycle">The Lifecycle of Dreamers</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">The average lifespan of a dreamer is anywhere from 75 to 100 years, depending on their realm's level of infrastructure. However, it is well documented everywhere that achieving Lucidity is synonymous with attaining immortality.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="awakening_lucidity">Awakening and Lucidity</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Dreamers who cultivate their acumen and achieve mastery of self gradually learn to apply their profound insights outwards, as the boundary between dreamer and dream disappears. The exact mechanics of this process are shrouded in mystery for those who have not experienced it first hand, who typically associate the achievement with immortality, its most well-known benefit. Those who have achieved Lucidity, however, typically suggest it is the least of their gifts.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="specializations">Specializations</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Few choices will affect a dreamer's capabilities and development so much as their area of specialization. There are nine areas to choose from, corresponding to the nine subschools of azaian magic. The nine specializations included in the game system are the most popular Thymoran interpretations of these areas of study rather than a complete encapsulation of them.</p> 

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="spell_tiers">Spell Tiers</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Since Lucidity is considered the highest form of achievement associated with azaian acumen, your progress will be measured relative to it at all times and, since the road is well-trod by this point, the hallmarks of achievement along the path are well understood and documented. There are six such plateaus in advancement that seem universal to all entities, colloquially referred to as Spell Tiers, and are often cited as the purest indicator of a dreamer's advancement. Achieving the first Spell Tier is generally considered a right of passage to adulthood, though most never progress past the second. As such, it is reasonable to expect that a new character will begin at the first Spell Tier and progress from there.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="leveling_up">Leveling Up</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">What this all boils down to is that as you level up, you will advance through the Spell Tiers as a consequence of progressing your chosen Specialization training. Levels are meant to represent the gradations between Spell Tiers and represent your advancement as an individual on your own journey to awakening, but they would never be referred to in-setting in a way that Spell Tiers would. For example, if asked for your qualifications, you wouldn't tell someone you were a level 4 Arcanist; you might tell them you were trained as an Arcanist and that you had achieved the second Spell Tier, though.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="courts_guilds_orders">Courts, Guilds, and Orders</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Courts are public organizations and serve as the basic geopolitical unit of the Dreamscape: the bureaucratic template which influences administrations for arcologies, stations, realms, and the like. While the interpretation and ultimate implementation of this structure may vary between Courts, they will generally be led by a council of ministers chaired by an Executor, a first among equals. Guilds and Orders generally private organizations devoted to a particular practice, art, enterprise, or ideology. Sometimes they operate locally within a single court, whereas others reach across realms.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="optios">The Role of Optios</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Reiciendis pariatur fugiat assumenda, fugit consequatur, labore mollitia nemo sapiente veniam commodi aperiam nostrum sint animi dolorem ut natus similique, quisquam perspiciatis.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionHead" id="where_you_fit">Where You Fit In</h4>
        <p class="sectionBody">Players will often (at least at first) be primarily associated with the Court presiding over the local area where they live. This is by design and thus also true for most dreamers: Courts are meant to function as an extended family, and strive to generate the feeling of belonging one might normally associate from being a community member of a small town where everyone each other. Like any extended family, everyone will have different areas of interest, so while many are happy to work on behalf of their Court as an easy way to care for both themselves and others, those who feel called to fulfill the more specific missions of a Guild or Order are amply supported in doing so as the relationship between these organizations is expected to be symbiotic.</p>
        <p class="sectionBody">For those uninterested or unsure of these paths, Optios will serve as an excellent source of direction. Every Optio runs an establishment from which they facilitate business, and even those who have not risen far enough to reach their personal notice can always find work offered by their associates who facilitate more minor matters.</p>
