            <h2 class="localHead">Dreamscape Key Points</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">The Dreamscape is a Space Fantasy setting that presupposes a high level of scientific and engineering expertise based on a unified theory of magic. As such, while it will bear many similarities to fantastical franchises we're familiar with, there are a few things I hope are new here as well. When other people have asked me about the campaign setting, I've defaulted to say I try to think of it as if the humans in Mass Effect were the futuristic descendants of the Wizarding World, and while I think that's an acceptable approximation, it doesn't really tell you anything about the setting itself. To that end, I've put together this list to try and set the vibe and give enough context for people to jump right in without necessarily needing to know any of the specifics of the stories we've told in the past.</p> 

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="azonai">The Azonai</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">It has long been understood by dragons that the Dreamscape itself arises from a singular fundament, which they refer to as the Azonai. While it's two forms, azon and azai, are readily apparent throughout the Dreamscape, the existence of the Azonai is implied rather than observed. To most Dreamers, the distinction doesn't really matter all that much: it's a known bit of cosmology that doesn't seem to weigh heavily on their day to day lives, and yet it underpins all the magic that flows through them every day...and even the days themselves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="pervasive_magic">Pervasive Magic</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">The dragons gave the name azai to the flowing aspect of the supreme fundament, and it is understood to be the essence of magic throughout the Dreamscape. The most notable manifestation of azai are the interstellar aurorae of the Azaian Flow, currents of azai which wend between stars and light up the skies of the realms, but ambient azai permeates the entirety of the Dream: it animates all living entities, and all dreamers can learn to channel it to produce magical effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="aurion">Aurion</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Many mechanisms can drive the conversion from azai to azon, the static manifestation of azonai. The most practical of these methods is the crafting of spell architecture, but the natural formation of aurion is thought of to be the most unique. Though its coloration varies based on where it forms, all aurion has a texture and appearance akin to a semi-translucent marble, but close inspection will prove that the glowing veins of the aurion move, charting internal currents of azaian energy that naturally replenish. The great gift of the dragon Azyra to Verin, the first Archon of Thymora, was the secret of how to rearrange the internal currents of azai within aurion: a process which allows it to permanently retain an enchantment. Aurion crystallizes in areas naturally rich in ambient azai, and its cultivation and extraction are heavily regulated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="arcanotech">Arcanotech</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Azaian magic is powerful, but rather ephemeral: for anyone less than a fully Lucid dreamer, enchantments must be actively channeled in order for them to persist. The advent of embedding azonian architecture inside of aurion (and, later, onai) led to the entire restructuring of society and rapid advancement of knowledge. It began with Foci (imagine, if you will, how important the invention of the wand might be to a society of wizards), and grew to include other ubiquitous devices such as unitools, talismans, arcanetics, and even the Gate Network itself. Thymorans believe that, with proper study and inquiry, there is no problem that cannot be mitigated and/or solved with cogent application of azaian magics, and that arcanotech is the means by which these solutions can be made accessible to everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="harmonic_path">The Harmonic Path</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">The dragon sage Oroxys developed his philosophy in direct opposition to his mother's dreams of draconic hegemony. His teachings became so popular as to be encoded as The Harmonic Path, and spread to all the realms of the Dream as the closest thing most dreamers have to a religion. In this case, however, no god is being appeased, and there is no heaven which is being sought. Instead, the numinous is found everywhere, everyday, and an entity's experience of it is promoted via the Three Relations, which enact harmony via mastery of self, compassion towards others, and responsible stewardship of the Dream.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="thymora">Thymora, the Shared Vision</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though much of the basis for Thymoran knowledge and philosophy has draconic origins, it was Verin, a dreamer, who first united the disparate factions of both Keshal and Zjen Meng. A meritocracy based on the teachings of the Harmonic Path, Thymora became a society of explorers and archivists who viewed the accumulation, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge as a sacred task. Its Gate Network grew to link hundreds of realms together, the peoples of which were all invited to send representatives to Keshal, that they might establish an enclave within Verin'kar, the Jade Tower.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="courts_arcologies">Courts and Arcologies</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though the realms of the Dream are home to all manner of different cultures of dreamers, some ideas, like the Harmonic Path, have become so popular as to be omnipresent. This has also been the case with Courts and Arcologies. Though their interpretation will be different everywhere, most all dreamers in this era come together to live in arcologies, massive structures which contain an entire city within a single footprint, administered by courts of elected local experts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="ancestral_veneration">Ancestral Veneration</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Thymorans revere their ancestors for the gifts of knowledge and the legacy they have left behind, one which finds inherent virtue in many hands working together towards a common goal for the security and freedom of specialization it affords every individual. Through specialization, one can cultivate the self and advance the corpus of knowledge gifted to us by our ancestors: this belief serves as the foundation of the meritocracy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="the_meritocracy">The Meritocracy</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Underpinned by a cultural obsession with self-mastery (colloquially referred to as “awakening”), a process which can lead any entity to Lucidity (immortality), this ideological framework ignores natural talent, and instead posits the ones you choose to hone over the course of your life to be the ones which define you in Thymora. There are myriad ways to cultivate oneself: which one you select is not nearly so important as how deeply you devote yourself to your chosen practice. Where you are from, to whom you are related...nothing is so important as your personal progress on the path of awakening, which cannot be faked or stumbled into without being ready, and thus serves adequately as a universal milestone. Such achievements do not merely confer status, however, but also responsibility: the Harmonic Path implores all adherents to serve their community according to the limits of their capabilities so that, together, as many needs as possible may be met.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="ostracism_reclamation">From Ostracism to Reclamation</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Thymora founded by Verin continued on, unbroken, for over two millennia before anyone was able to threaten the peaceful transfer of power between Archons. A secret cabal called the Chorus of Ancestors, headed by some of the Archon's own minsters, attempted to wrest control of the Seat of Dreams, a powerful foci containing the power of all previous Archons, from Ahr-Deth, the Seat's current occupmant. They partially succeeded, in that Ahr-Deth, his heir Jian, and many of their allies were either killed outright or trapped perpetually in magical stasis. It failed spectacularly, however, in every other fashion: the Gate Network which tied the realms together was severed unintentionally, unleashing a powerful blast of energy at every single place it had an outlet. In the more than two and a half centuries since their attempted coup, Thymorans on their disparate realms have fractured into independent Courts seeking to find a way to reclaim the legacy of their ancestors. They have achieved varying degrees of success, though none of them were able to reactivate the Gate and find their way back to the Jade Tower until recently. Now, however, Gates throughout the realms have been sputtering to life, if momentarily in most cases.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Who is behind these phenomena is as yet unknown, but one thing is for certain: someone once again sits upon the Seat of Dreams. From all corners can be heard murmurs of excitement at the prospect that the Ostracism may finally be over. Whoever our new Archon is, Thymora's age of Reclamation dawns.</p>
