                <p class="sectionBody">Thymoran Dreams is an immersive space fantasy role playing game crafted to allow Players to explore the Dreamscape: a setting where mind and matter intertwine, and magic is as pervasive as air.</p>

            <!-- Players -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="players">Players</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">The GM is responsible for playing the role of adjudicator and maintaining/communicating the actions of the game environment and NPC actors. They set the stage for the players to act upon.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">PCs are responsible for the customization and maintenance of their characters' statistics, and how their characters navigate the game environment presented to them by the GM.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">At minimum, Players should have 1d20 and 1d6, but as many as 5 of each, and a single d12. The maximum amount of dice rolled for any check would be 5d20 and 5d6 simultaneously.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- The Gameplay Loop -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="gameplay_loop">The Gameplay Loop</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">As a collaborative storytelling game, many of the occurrences within the game space can simply be based on freeform narration between the GM and Players. In instances where what might happen is either unclear, the GM may opt to resolve the situation via calling for a check to be made. In these instances, it is up to the GM to determine which stats and modifiers apply to the situation in order to evaluate its outcome.</p>

                    <!-- Example Text -->
                    <p class="exampleText">Kelorin may want to climb a wall in the abandoned areas of Katahven. Kelorin is big and strong, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s skilled at climbing (he is not); even so, he can still add his Force stat to the roll, giving him a +2 bonus. The wall he’s trying to climb has a good amount of hand-holds, it’s not as sheer as it might have been were it not in a state of disrepair, but because he still lacks any skill in this particular activity, the GM applies a penalty of -5 to his check. Combined with his +2 Force bonus, Kelorin will roll a d20 and subtract 3 from the result.</p>

                    <p class="exampleText">Kelorin does not have anything to provide him with a d20 polarity bonus, and since he has not trained in this activity his d6 pool will not apply either. This means that his dice pools are set to their default values: he rolls just 1d20, and gets a 1. That’s about the worst thing that could happen, but rather than accepting defeat Kelorin invokes a Lucidity Token, allowing him to reroll the check. This time his d20 rolls a 12. Applying the -3 modifier from above, his final result is a 9, which corresponds to a Partial Success. Not bad!</p>

                    <p class="exampleText">The GM decides that a Partial Success in this case means Kelorin does make it to the top of the wall, however, he dislodges a section of the wall which falls to the ground below. It doesn’t look like anyone is around to take notice, but still, he isn’t exactly supposed to be here, so leaving a trail for someone to potentially follow is not ideal.</p>

                    <p class="exampleText">That’s it! From here, the Player can decide if Kelorin continues on and hopes for the best, or tries to react to the result in another way.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Making Checks -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="making_checks">Making Checks</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">The formula for determining a check's final result is a relatively simple mathematical calculation: dice pool result + bonuses - penalties = final result. Every result corresponds to one of five Degrees of Success, with higher results correlating to more favorable Degrees.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Dice Pools -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="dice_pools">Dice Pools</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">Characters have two separate dice pools that are available to them during a check: their d20 pool, and their d6 pool. At its most fundamental, a Player’s dice pool consists of a single d20, but may expand to include up to 5d20 *and* 5d6 depending on their Polarity.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Polarity -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="polarity">Polarity</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">When a character is more or less likely to accomplish a specific action, their Polarity will reflect that. The Polarity of each dice pool will determine how many of each die you cast in a given check, and which result you select among them. Both dice pools have a maximum Polarity of +/-5, but slightly different rules governing them.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">The d20 pool has a default Polarity of 1, and cannot have values of 0 or -1, as indicated by the scale below. The number of the pool’s polarity indicates how many die will be cast, and its sign will determine which result is selected among them. A d20 Polarity of +4 means the player would roll 4d20 and select the highest result among them; meanwhile, a Polarity of -3 means the player would roll 3d20 and select the lowest result.</p>

                    <!-- Example Text -->
                    <p class="exampleTextCenter">d20 pool Polarity scale:</p>
                    <p class="exampleTextCenter">-5 (minimum) <-> -4 <-> -3 <-> -2 <-> 1 (default) <-> +2 <-> +3 <-> +4 <-> +5 (maximum)</p>

                    <p class="sectionBody">Unlike the d20 pool, the d6 pool only comes into play in specific instances, such as if the Player has invested points into subschool training, or are under the effects of a spell, and the highest result will always be selected among the d6 they cast. If their d6 pool’s Polarity is negative, however, then their d6 result will be subtracted from their result rather than added.</p>

                    <p class="exampleTextCenter">d6 pool Polarity scale:</p>
                    <p class="exampleTextCenter">-5 (minimum) <-> -4 <-> -3 <-> -2 <-> 0 (default) <-> 1 <-> +2 <-> +3 <-> +4 <-> +5 (maximum)</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Modifiers -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="modifiers">Modifiers</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">Most checks made during play will be subjected to modifiers which either add to, or subtract from, the result of a character's dice pools. Modifiers are applied after the results of each dice pool are selected in order to determine a check's final result, which is then compared against the Degrees of Success.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Bonuses -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="bonuses">Bonuses - Additive Modifiers</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">For characters, the most common sources of bonuses will be their chosen statistic distribution, any training they have undergone, magical items they bear, and spell effects. For PCs, most of these sources are completely within their control to allow a fully customizable experience.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Penalties -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="penalties">Penalties - Subtractive Modifiers</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">Typical subtractive modifiers will involve standard difficulty penalties applied to an action based on the circumstance. If someone tries to attack you, then your Defense stat will be subtracted from their check as a penalty. Other times, there is no explicit difficulty penalty for a check, but they would still be challenging in and of themselves, in which case the GM may choose to add a penalty to the check. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Degrees of Success -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="degrees_of_success">Degrees of Success</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">There are five general Degrees of Success, and thus five possible outcomes of any check: Falter, Failure, Partial Success, Full Success, and Plus. Once an entity's dice have been rolled and any relevant modifiers have been applied, the result is compared against the degrees of success to determine the effect of their actions. With the exception of free-casting, the effects of most abilities are listed out at each Degree within the Reference document.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Natural 1 - Instant Falter</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">If the result of an entity's d20 pool is a 1, the check's degree is Falter regardless of modifiers. If a PC's d20 pool generates this result, they gain a Lucidity Token.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Falter - >0</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A negative result means the action goes about as poorly as possible. If the action is an attack, the target is granted a free Retaliatory Strike: a quick attack which can inflict damage, but not status effects..</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Natural 1 - Instant Falter</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">If the result of an entity's d20 pool is a 1, the check's degree is Falter regardless of modifiers. If a PC's d20 pool generates this result, they gain a Lucidity Token.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Failure - 0-4</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The action is unsuccessful, along with any potential penalties and/or consequences that result.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Partial Success - 5-13</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The action mostly succeeds, but generally not in the way the actor intended. </p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Full Success - 14-19</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The action occurs as intended, or as much as possible given present circumstances.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Plus - 20+</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The action succeeds in a way that surpasses expectations.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Natural 20 - Instant Success</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">If the result of an entity's d20 pool is a 20, the check's degree is a Plus regardless of modifiers. If a PC's d20 pool generates this result, they also gain a Lucidity Token.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Lucidity Tokens -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="lucidity_tokens">Lucidity Tokens</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">Lucidity Tokens are generated automatically when the result of a PCs d20 pool is either a 1 or a 20, but they may also be awarded by the GM to PCs at any time and for any reason. PCs may store a number equal to their level.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">PCs may use a Lucidity token to invoke their Attributes to automatically achieve a Full Success degree on a check, so long as the GM agrees that it applies to the situation. If a PC wishes to attempt to roll a check for a chance at a Plus result rather than settling for an automatic Full Success, Lucidity tokens may also be invoked to re-roll any check a player makes and select either result.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Turn Order -->
            <div class="gridbox"> 
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="turn_order">Turn Order</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">In situations where multiple checks will be required to determine the outcome of a given sequence of events, and/or the specific order of those events is of great consequence (e.g in combat, or a chase scene), the GM may initiate a Turn Order. The Turn Order progresses in Rounds, broken up into Faction Turns, in which all characters working together act at the same time. There will always be at least two Factions in any given encounter: the Players, and the Environment.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">For every Round of the Turn Order, PCs may execute any 2 Actions available to them by default, 1 of which may be a Reaction executed outside of its Faction's Turn.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Actions -->
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="actions">Actions</h4>

                <p class="sectionBody">In general, you can think of Actions as anything your character might do to interact with the game space. The eight General Actions listed below should cover anything you might think to come up with!</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Boost</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Offer a helping hand. Roll your own dice pool for a check someone else is in the process of making. If they so choose, the person you’re helping can use the result of your dice pool instead of theirs. Their own modifiers still apply, though!</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Counter</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Modifiers: + Recovery | - Attack</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Try to mitigate negative effects in the moment, or shake them off after they’ve been applied. This can apply to anything from resisting the effects of a spell to putting out a fire on your person.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Free-Cast</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Modifiers: Casting Secondary and Substats</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Improvise a custom spell. There’s always a little risk when casting like this, moreso when trying to go beyond your limits, but how can you learn if you don’t push your boundaries?</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Interaction</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Modifiers: Applicable Primary Stat</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">This is a general catch-all action meant to account for all the different ways in which you might engage with the environment. Lie convincingly, parse information from arcane material, or even break down a door!</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Movement</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Spend some time moving through space. Pretty straightforward: we’ve all taken walks before, and run on occasion.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Recharge</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Modifiers: + Recovery</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Much like breathing, dreamers are capable of drawing in ambient magic from the environment. This can be used to refresh your shields, and potentially free-cast more frequently.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Skills</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Modifiers: Secondary, Substats</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Skills are things your character has learned to do, trained over time to such efficiency that you might execute them as naturally as walking. Your class features and any spells you learn will fall under this category.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead">Stabilize</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Modifiers: + Recovery, Harmonics/Transmutation</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Not everyone is trained as a medical professional, but anyone can attempt to render first aid to those in need.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">That’s it! That’s everything you really need to know about the game in order to begin playing. There’s obviously much more to cover about how your character will work, but all of those things will function as a supplement to the topics we’ve begun to cover here.
