        <div class="localContent">
            <!-- Page Content -->
            <h2 class="localHead">Dramatis Personae</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">The Dream has been shaped by the entities within it, many of whom have left enduring marks. The below list is by no means exhaustive, but does its best to account for as many prominent figures in the setting as possible.</p> 

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="ascendants">Ascendants</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Entities which have merged themselves with an azaian nexus are rare, with the knowledge of their transformation having only recently been rediscovered.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="the_collective">The Collective</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">When Verin crafted the Seat of Dreams, he designed it as a supplementary focus meant to be wielded by future archons. To empower such a device, it was designed in the manner of a spirit willow, capable of accepting and distilling the power and memories of an entity as they died, and he began the as-yet-unbroken tradition for archons to bequeath their power and wisdom to those who come after. When Slag, then in service to the Chorus, attempted to sabotage the Seat, it had the unforeseen consequence of leading both constructs to sentience. The spirits in the Seat coalesced into a single ascendant, and Slag became their first herald, a harbinger of Thymora's renewal...and reimagining.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="verin">Verin, the First</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The catalyst for unification, first of Keshal and then the entire Thymora system. Verin grew up a disciple of the eight immortals and earned near universal respect from his virtuous and genuine manner with everyone he met on his extensive travels. He was the first dreamer to earn the respect of Fengara, if begrudgingly.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="aren_ko">Aren-Ko, the Second</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Aren-Ko's affable nature and sense of adventure earned Thymora's first friends among the stars, and laid the foundation for the interrealm federation. Through his efforts, Verin'kar's levels filled with embassies from realms far beyond their own.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="avaly">Avaly, the Third</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Avaly was a philosopher and lover of all forms of art who ensured Thymora's culture and their people were able to keep pace with their rapid expansion.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="yzet">Yzet, the Fourth</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Yzet was a brilliant scientist who oversaw a massive expansion of Thymoran infrastructure and exploration apparatus to plumb the secrets of the Deep Dream, but her integrity is what she is remembered for. Her projects required more than many Courts would have given under normal circumstances, and to disastrous effect; yet, when issues arose, she abandoned her ambitions in favor of making reparations.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="raikos">Raikos, the Fifth</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Raikos planned to divest much of the Archon's power to the Legion in order to evolve into the role of a spiritual guide and protector of the federation. Though his proposed reforms were postponed by the Grey Tide, his work has been the template that all Archons since have strove to manifest.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="shorei">Shorei, the Sixth</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Shorei was the answer Thymora needed to the arishaz: the greatest warrior that has ever been. She was Thymora's guiding star through the trials of the Grey Tide, and the reason Thymora alone survived it.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="kuang">Kuang, the Seventh</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Kuang's tactical insight made him the perfect companion for Shorei, and allowed Thymora to cleanse the Dream of the Tide once and for all. His reign was cut short, betrayed by Fengara, who had raised him as her own. </p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="ahr_deth">Ahr-Deth, the Eighth</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Ahr-Deth ascended to the Seat of Dreams having built a movement of returning to the ideal of Raikos' reforms, but before he was able to solidify that movement's place firmly within the Courts of Verin'kar. Though he and the rest of Thymora were unprepared for the treachery of the Chorus, Ahr-Deth's ability to withstand their trap and eventually help grant deliverance to all those caught with him leaves a legacy of one singularly enduring and unbreakable.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="jian">Jian, the Ninth</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Even while ensnared in the Chorus' trap, Jian was able to orchestrate a movement that resulted in their downfall and her freedom. Thefirst revenant is also the first to wield the power of the Seat of Dreams as the avatar of its resident ascendant, and now works to reimagine the archonate as it enters the Second Renewal.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="twilight_council">The Twilight Council</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">When agents of the Revenant Order created a conduit between the Oracle Archives and the Azjeran necropolis, its guardian spirits were empowered and gained ascendance. While many of its constituent specters continue to maintain a presence in Azjera and ensure its safety, they also now roam the paths of the Oracle, safeguarding access to Sho'ken for all children of the Legion.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The first dreamers to achieve Lucidity were interred in the necropolis of Azjera, guardians of the first spirit willow and the ancestral wisdom of Thymora. Each a legendary figure in their own right, they now sit at the head of the Council along with Kisono. Along with Verin, the Immortals were the only disciples of Oroxys to survive the cataclysm that engulfed their first school. Though Vazyr and Xie-Ming were always considered contemporaries, the others originally began as Xie-Ming's pupils.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="kisono">Kisono</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A beloved companion of Mother Kala and the serving dragon Chancellor during the reign of the archon Ahr-Deth and Rakos both, Kisono was trapped in a stasis along with the entire arcology of Azjera during the Ostracism. Though eventually freed, the spirits of the arcology chose to remain bound as guardians of the necropolis' spirit willow and dispensers of its sacred duty. Kisono sits at the head of the Council, revered for his strength and wisdom both.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="vazyr">Vazyr Augustmind, the Guide Along Paths Between Worlds</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The first dreamer to achieve Lucidity, Vazyr is said to have awoken after being instructed by Oroxys to meditate before a nexus, which he then used as a means of exploring the other dimensions of the Dreamscape. This discovery and subsequent observation by both Vazyr and Oroxys led to the conception of a Unified Theory, which laid the foundations of the Harmonic Path.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="xie_ming">Xie-Ming Twinspirit, the Teachers Who Walk One Step Behind</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A disciple of Oroxys and contemporary of Vazyr, Xie-Ming is a gifted educator who proved instrumental to the dissemination of the Harmonic Path and its resultant school of thought. Initially two separate individuals, their souls and bodies fused into a single entity as a means of survival in the wake of a failed assassination attempt. Their coloration is split in two as a result of this fusion, one part inky blue, the other gray. After the Chasm swallowed their first home, they moved to Azjera to continue their teaching, and began codifying the first educational curricula for the entire Legion. Except for their contemporary, all of the other immortals, and even Verin and Aren-Ko, are counted among Xie-Ming's pupils.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="senzo">Senzo Stardrift, the Navigator of Mysteries Beyond the Horizon</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Inspired by a dragon's ability to fly even through the void of space, Senzo built the first flying ship capable of mimicking this feat, and eventually built upon it to devise a projected shield that could withstand the forces within Heaven's Eye. Before Aren-Ko could traverse the Eye to build the Thymoran federation, Senzo, along with his crew and companion, the dragon Calaras, began mapping the wormhole network and befriending those they encountered. A man with an unquenchable thirst for adventure, even his internment within the necropolis was accepted as a new mode of exploration.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="yu_lan">Yu-Lan Hallowstorm, the Weaver Whose Threads Reknit the World</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Even though her contributions to the field of spell architecture are still utilized daily by anyone who casts spells, Yu-Lan is almost exclusively venerated for what that knowledge empowered her to do. As Fengara's influence amongst dreamers began to wane, a failed plot to assassinate the disciples of Oroxys resulted in a vortex that threatened to engulf what remained of Keshal. Instead, Yu-Lan became the first entity to ever quell a vortex, a feat previously believed to have been impossible.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="hamyda">Hamyda Mistform, the Figure Yet Hewn From Stone</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A student so gifted that she inspired Azyra to defy her mother and share the secrets of aurion with dreamers, Hamyda defined onai as the third known phase of the azonai. Capable of storing permanent enchantments, onai allowed Hamyda to invent the first unitool prototype and fill in the gaps of the Unified Theory proposed by the Harmonic Path. </p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="okakura">Okakura Runecrest, the Form of An Idea Made Real</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">While Hamyda and Yu-Lan toiled endlessly in their own studies, Okakura applied the knowledge they uncovered in order to advance their understanding. When Hamyda theorized it might be possible to embed Yu-Lan's stable spell architectures within aurion to store a permanent enchantment, it was Okakura who built the first prototypes to prove it could be done. He effectively pioneered the entire field of arcanetics, but it is the invention of the focus for which he is most admired.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="zohana">Zohana Thoughtsmith, the Sign that Points the Way</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A philosopher and political theorist, Zohana expanded upon the Harmonic Path by suggesting a form of governance structured around it, specifically the assertion that everything within the Dream is a reflection of the same infinite source. She argued that dreamers should abandon the practices of primogeniture and autocracy in favor of democracy and meritocracy, and proposed reforms to the Court system which now form the basis for the Thymoran ideal. The first Chancellor of Hollow Stone, Zohana was able to hone her philosophy through lived experience to create a model representative of the entire Legion.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="zanele">Zanele Evensong, the Enchantress Who Brings Dreams to Life</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Like Hamyda and Yu-Lan, Zohana also needed someone to put her work into practice, and Zanele was eager to oblige. Long respected as a negotiator and ambassador of Oroxys and his school, she was easily appointed Executor of the neutral arcology of Hollow Stone along the shores of the sacred Meridian Lake. From there, she enacted Zohana's reforms and set the model which Verin later exported to the other courts of Keshal. Rather than compromise the neutral status of Hollow Stone during the process of unification, Zanele instead championed Verin as Archon, effectively cementing his claim through her influence alone.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="alteraph">Alteraph</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A phoenix of the Oracle, Alteraph is the only known of her kind, and the most ancient known living entity within the Dreamscape. Betrayed and sequestered for aeons by Bronokh's treachery, Alteraph has recently been restored by Almoran and the other Revenants as they completed her ancient ritual to render the Nightmare inert. Now she seeks to uphold the Pact she once dreamed into being, that all entities of the Dream might live in harmony.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="omnox">Omnox, the Hand That Pulls</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The suzerain of the Dark Star Terminus and one of the oldest known entities in existence, Omnox has long existed as an archetypal spirit: the Red Man. A former being of Nightmare who aided Alteraph in devising a ritual to neutralize the existential threat to the Dreamscape and a devout hedonist, Omnox now helps to maintain stability in the Dreamscape for the express purpose of continuing his own fun, which often includes deals with desperate dreamers.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="volar">Volar, the Voice That Pushes</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A being of implacable curiosity and ambition, Volar rose from obscurity as a once-nameless researcher for Bronokh's corrupted Renewal Guard to become one of his most trusted advisors, a trust which she eventually betrayed. After learning of Omnox's existence and captivity, she cast off her subservience and his shackles both, and eventually the two became genuine companions. Less inclined to deals than her counterpart, Volar is nevertheless a constant unseen shadow through the world of dreamers who pushes people to take risks that she might observe the unfolding results.</p>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="dragons">Dragons</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Born from the core of a dying star, dragons are the rarest entities within the Dreamscape. When hatched within their stellar nursery, they ascend in the moment of their birth, a process which drives most of them insane. Of the remaning dragons within the dream, however, only Arselion and Fengara were born in this manner; the others were hatched safely on Zjen Meng, and achieved Lucidity through their own merit.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="arselion">Arselion</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Trapped by the Celebrants and kept secret by Fengara for millennia as she fed off his power, Arselion has proven to nevertheless be generous and jovial since his discovery and freedom. Unique even for a dragon, Arselion's body appears to be that of a fluid blue-black gemstone, though whether this is a result of the Sentinel's ministrations, the indignities he suffered at his sister's hands, or for some other reason is unknown. He currently resides on Zjen Meng, helping his devout Obsidian Conclave in their efforts to rebuild the realm and minister to Kalen'toz.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="agirot">Agirot</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The first friend of Kala and the keeper of her secrets, Agirot was nearly killed on Antaris during the collapse of the Gate Network at the start of the Ostracism. He survived and took on the guise of a dreamer and took shelter amongst a secluded community while searching for a way to restore his body and vitality. Eventually revitalized by his grandson, Guillot, the silver-and-blue dragon returned to Antaris and incited a rebellion against the Ylin to restore Thymoran control there. Though outwardly presenting as a trickster, Agirot is deeply serious in his intent.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="azyra">Azyra</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Verin's partner and the first dragon Chancellor of Thymora, the red-and-black dragon Azyra was also the first of her siblings to outwardly defy the Ruby Broodmother. Granting dreamers insight into the mysteries of aurion, she was directly responsible for the birth of arcanetics and the ability for dreamers to rival dragons in potency. She is often invoked as a symbol of justice and bravery.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="calaras">Calaras</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The first dragon to discover they could breathe in the void of space, Calaras ever pushed his siblings to explore the bounds of their knowledge. He was the first of his brood to fully map Zjen Meng, and led his siblings on the first expedition to Keshal. After the Unification, he traveled with Senzo Stardrift through Heaven's Eye to map its paths through the Dream. Even after his companion returned home to adventure along different paths, Calaras continued sailing the sea of stars, and those who journeyed with him eventually grew into an entire fleet of accompanying vessels. Though he was separated from most of his fleet and dealt a near-mortal blow during the Ostracism, Calaras believes his people still voyage somewhere out amongst the stars and intends to find them.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="fengara">Fengara, the Ruby Broodmother</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ruby Broodmother's emergence from stasis marks the beginning of the Charted Eras, a fact which, to her mind, is justification for her right to dictate the course of history. Though she has yet to succeed in any meaningful or lasting capacity, Fengara's plans have ever bent towards dominion. Her corporeal form was sundered during her betrayal of the archon Kuang, and her spirit is currently housed in a yujai vessel.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="gujen">Gujen</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A prolific artist, Gujen's talents tend particularly towards sculpture. She sculpted the first arcology, Hollow Stone, from the body of a single mountain along the shores of Meridian Lake, and was later instrumental in helping Verin during the construction of the Jade Tower.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="oroxys">Oroxys</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Said to be the most enlightened being in the Dream, the dragon sage Oroxys devised the philosophy of the Harmonic Path. After an attempt on his life resulted in the destruction of his original school, Oroxys ensured the dissemination of his ideas by constantly traveling and teaching, which were monumental in revolutionizing the culture of Thymora and eventually paved the way towards unification. Once the way through Heaven's Eye was discovered, Oroxys rarely ever returned to Thymora, instead choosing to constantly travel to new places to both spread his teachings and learn in turn. In recent centuries, however, he has taken to roosting on Ringrealm, watching over the mysteries of the past.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="selyn">Selyn</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dragon of mysteries, Selyn is perhaps the most ephemeral of her kin. A vaunted shapeshifter, it is said she has manipulated the outcome of many historical events without anyone ever knowing. Unseen in over two millennia, she nevertheless has a devoted culture of strange dreamers on a realm they named in her honor. Though they will never divulge the nature of their intentions, nor the manner in which they receive their instruction, they nevertheless move with a purpose as opaque as their master.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">An unlikely duo from two distinct eras of history, they find themselves in the clutches of a mysterious but potent curse that constantly sends them hurtling across all dimensions of the Dreamscape. Though the circumstances they find themselves in are often dire, they often have litte context for such matters and generally behave as psychedelic figments of a fever dream.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="lian_shi">Lian Shi Omentoll, the Hope that Bears the Light of Dawn to the Horizon</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">An arcanetic savant, Lian Shi was born on the relatively obscure realm Veilhem without a left arm. With no other solutions forthcoming, she became an autodidact who quickly adapted by learning to manifest her astral body in place of her missing limb before eventually inventing the means to make herself a prosthetic limb of aurion. Even upon a remote realm with no connection to Heaven's Eye, rumors of her abilities eventually reached Keshal; she was recruited and groomed by the Chorus before she had even become a teenager.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">On Keshal, she eventually founded the Kala Laboratories, dedicated to developing a new generation of arcanomatons in service of her patrons. To realize these ambitions, she pioneered a new pattern for arcanomaton core architecture which ultimately culminated with Project SLAG. Though she was eventually betrayed by her masters once the project was complete, it was already too late: Lian Shi had created the requisite conditions for an emergent consciousness, a miracle which eventually returned to offer her freedom.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Since her emergence from stasis, Lian Shi has dedicated herself to supporting Slag and their creations. Through her efforts, she has become an invaluable ally to the Revenants, and a confidante to the archon Jian.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="lyna">Lyna Cloudcall</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A former investigator for Rune Clasp's Court of Feathers, Lyna left her old life behind after the Revenants assisted her in uncovering the Cult of Fengara's presence in her arcology. Since then, she has become a disciple of the Collective alongside her old friend, Thirra, in order to help restabilize the Thymora system in the wake of the Ostracism.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="the_nine">The Nine</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Chosen by Jian to lead their people from their home on the realm of Antaris back to Keshal, the Nine successfully guided the people of the Peregrine Court through a harrowing pilgrimage across their realm and back to the Thymora system. While the Revenant Order were the ultimate harbingers of the Second Renewal, the Nine built and sustained the apparatus that supported them.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="kiria">Executor Kiria Lightpath</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">An archeologist and relative pariah among the Ylin on Antaris, Kiria spent a good portion of her youth traveling to obscure sites in order to piece together information about Thymora that had been lost during the Ostracism. Such frequent roaming allowed her to develop friendships among the many different courts around the realm prior to the Pilgirmage, which made her uniquely qualified to build a coalition amongst the disparate dreamers who had answered Jian's call. </p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="vin">Chancellor Vin Evensight</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Trained to be an unquestioning tool to be wielded by others, Vin has found freedom in the nuance afforded by critique. His advisory role for the executor has the feel of a sacred duty to him, and for that he feels right at home. </p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="song_ah">Legate Song-Ah Thoughtflower</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A spymistress for the Ylin before she was called to service by Jian, Song-Ah was responsible for adopting and educating Xochil and Umiro. Relentlessly on-task, she has been able to apply her care for others to a broader context in her role as Legate of the Peregrine Court's Legionary Council.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="takh">Takh Notesong, Minister of Legions</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">It is often hard to tell if Takh is being overly serious, or just incredibly dry. Long obsessed by the degradations of education on Antaris, he has made the restoration of the Nine Colleges of paramount priority since arriving on Keshal.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="allaria">Allaria Greenbough, Minister of Rites</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Before the Pilgrimage, Allaria was a surveyor of abandoned sections of Antaris, but not one affiliated with any Court. Freelancing was not often glamorized on Antaris, and yet she has seen first hand how her own efforts were still a worthy contribution to her home. In her time on Keshal, Allaria has done her best to encourage all members of the Legion to contribute in what way seems best to them, and has been more than happy to assist people in finding out what that is.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="ysmora">Ysmora Darkhand, Minister of Archives</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A thief of circumstance in her youth, Ysmora has reconstructed the Peregrine Court's economy to ensure that struggles such as hers are left in the past for all members of the Legion: life is hard enough as it is. Even so, she misses the rush of adrenaline.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="mara">Mara Pureheart, Minister of Harmony</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The first disciple of the Collective, Mara heard their call before Jian's. Altruistic to a fault, she is often to be found ministering to those in her care above and beyond her required duties.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="da_xin">Da-Xin Starshield, Minister of Wards</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Born to the descendents of Calaras' fleet who had accompanied him to Antaris, Da-Xin was trained from birth to be their defender. While his charge is now greater than that of the small court he was born to, the well-natured warrior has relished the opportunity to hone and advance his craft on a larger stage.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="zell">Zell Dreamcloud, Minster of Works</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">An engineer of no small skill, Zell was the only member of the Pilgrimage capable of restoring Slag to working order when he was discovered amongst the ruins near Jian's former citadel on Antaris. He has been the foremost advocate for integrating sentient constructs into the Legion.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="thirra">Thirra Havenguard</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Revenants' first friend on Keshal, Thirra proved crucial to their ability to build a coalition amongst the realm's natives. One of the first dreamers to devote themselves to the Collective after their emergence, she has become perhaps the most public-facing of their disciples.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="vyda">Vyda Bronzemoon, the Dancer Who Sways to the Rhythm of the Dream</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Born a slave to the Chorus, Vyda's first attempt at freedom resulted in her capture and near-sacrifice at the hands of the Cult of Fengara. Saved by the timely intervention of Guillot and the other Revenants, Vyda has since blossomed into one of the most talented engineers on Keshal and earned fame as the First Mate of the legendary vessel, the Highest Wind.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="umiro">Umiro Silentheart, the Current that Bears the Vessel Downstream</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Preceptor of the Revenant Order, Umiro's ability to convincingly assume almost any identity has given them a unique insight into how people work, and thus how to predict their behavior. Xochil's oldest friend, the pair were trained as covert operatives on Antaris before the Pilgrimage, all skills which have served them well in service of the archon Jian.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">A common ancestor for modern dreamers in the Thymora system, Kala was a Celebrant who, during the Uncharted Eras, helped throw off the rule of the Dragon Ascendancy and preserve life in the Dream against the threat of the Nightmare. The only of her colleagues to survive their extended stasis and unable to find any of her people able and willing to help, Kala resolved to undertake the process of Renewal alone. Though she befriended many of the dragons who visited Keshal during this time, even their aid could not prevent the process from taking her life. </p>
                <p class="sectionBody">While she could not codify all of her knowledge prior to her death, the information she left behind for her children and the dragons both was of astounding practicality and significance. Ever since, her example has inspired successive generations of ancestor worship amongst dreamers, who venerate those of them who leave their treasures behind for those who come after.</p>
