            <h2 class="localHead">Entities</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">Living beings with self awareness are referred to as entities within the Dreamscape. While there is generally a large variety in the manifestations of the many different forms of life, all entities share two traits that are specific to their classification: astral bodies, and attunements.</p> 

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="astral_bodies">Astral Bodies</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Reiciendis pariatur fugiat assumenda, fugit consequatur, labore mollitia nemo sapiente veniam commodi aperiam nostrum sint animi dolorem ut natus similique, quisquam perspiciatis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="attunements">Attunements</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">There are seven known facets of the Dreamscape, and all entities are born with an affinity for one of them over the others. An entity's attunement does not place any concrete limiters on their growth, though it does affect both their physical appearance and the way their magic manifests. </p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="catalytic">Catalytic</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Change, associated with fire, birth, death, and transmutation magic. Passionate, driven, and self-motivated, Catalytic dreamers often have a cause and are ready to see it through. They prefer dynamic environments, but whether that's a leading role in the Legion, the smooth operation of an Optio, or the rush of gladiatorial combat is entirely up to the individual.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Catalytic dreamers have specific acumen with spells that deal with fire or the concentration and release of energy. Though the talent is often associated with a seeming immunity to fire, they are able to withstand and safely conduct large amounts of many types of energy through their body without being harmed.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="fluid">Fluid</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Flow, most commonly associated with azai, the interstellar Flow, and conduction and harmonic magics. Though they may not intend to, Fluid dreamers often tend to treat life as a grand adventure in which the journey, not the destination, is the primary focus. Though there is a perhaps earned stereotype for their affinity to coastal regions, they are just as likely to settle roots somewhere that brings them peace as they are to live a life of traveling.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Fluid dreamers have specific acumen with spells controlling matter in its liquid state. They have an innate ability to tread upon or traverse any liquid.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="luminal">Luminal</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Light: all occurrences leave behind a trace. Light, echoes, records, stories, augury magic, and the Reliquary are aligned with this attunement. Luminal dreamers are easily identified for the unique bioluminescent patterns on their skin, which often seem to shift and flow under close inspection. They make enthralling visual artists and lecturers, but are just as often happy to be hidden away in a quiet corner of an archive.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Luminal dreamers have a relationship with light and its presence and absence within the Dream. They have a bonus to spells interacting with these forces, and may use these powers to comfort and mesmerise others.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="organic">Organic</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of organized Growth. Associated with animist magics, the emergent miracles of life and consciousness, and the natural changes that occur in the dream as a result of this. Organic attuned dreamers live for cultivation, whether it be collecting trinkets, growing things, building them, or helping others, and they typically exude an aura of calm. As a result, they are often regarded with easy trust, even, and sometimes especially, including wildlife.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Organic dreamers are especially proficient with spells involving life and other emergent processes. They have enhanced natural regeneration and the ability to use their telepathy to commune with all living beings rather than just dreamers.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="spatial">Spatial</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Space: the stage upon which the Dreamscape is set. Often associated with air, wide open space, the Interstice, and translocation magics. Spatial attuned dreamers often find themselves unbound by gravity, developing access to flight naturally as they age. Energetic and flighty, they feel most at home in wide open spaces, scenic vistas, and anywhere they've yet to explore.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Spatial dreamers are specifically in tune with the air and empty spaces of the dream, giving them proficiency in spells relating to these areas. They have an innate ability to fly, and can hold their breath for as long as they choose.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="static">Static</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Stasis. Most commonly associated with azon, occlusion magics, and the physical world. Static-attuned dreamers often have thick skin, but whether this manifests as a thick hide or as semi-fluid rock or metal or somewhere in between will vary from person to person. They often feel comfortable on or under solid ground, which, for many of them, proves as easy to move through as air.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Static dreamers have specific acumen with spells regarding solid matter and the physical world. They have the ability to move through unwarded walls and other solid surfaces.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="visionary">Visionary</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The facet of Possibility: things that have been or could come to pass. Associated with the Oracle, dreams, perception and enchantment magics. Natural shapeshifters, Visionary attuned dreamers are uniquely capable of experiencing the world from varied vantage points. Though most eventually sculpt a preferred appearance for themselves, it is also not unusual for visionaries to alter their visage in a manner akin to changing clothes.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Visionary dreamers are proficient with spells that augment an object's existing physical properties, and have the ability to shapeshift.</p>

                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="entity_types">Entity Types</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Entities are incredibly adaptable and very often in flux so that the lines between them are often blurred. As such, there are not many different categories that they fall into. Differentiation is often derived from an entity's origination: that is, ascendants are entities formed by the fusion of consciousness with a Nexus and avatars are entities empowered specifically by an ascendant; dragons are specifically hatched from an egg crystallized in the heart of a dying star; dreamers are mortal entities born via traditional means of reproduction; elementals arise from the remnants of a dead entity in a manner akin to a ghost; sentient constructs are entities that, through some mechanism, have developed an emergent consciousness of their own; and spiritsong is not necessarily thought of as an individual entity but rather a localized manifestation of the consciousness that pervades the Dreamscape.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="ascendants">Ascendants</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Of all the entities within the Dreamscape, none are so rare as Ascendants. Often thought of as gods by the cultures which revere them, ascendants are entities that have fused with an interdimensional nexus to become something akin to a star: agents capable of reshaping the Flow in their image. The more prominent ascendants of the Dream have all agreed to a concord referred to only as The Pact: a code of conduct aimed at preserving the Dreamscape's internal cohesion.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="avatars">Avatars</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Entities empowered directly by an ascendant are referred to as avatars. The Archons of Thymora are perhaps the best example of an avatar: though the Collective has declared it their aim to oversee the growth and stability of Thymora in perpetuity, their expanded consciousness, power, and perspective can make it hard for Thymorans to relate to them directly. An avatar, however, can serve as a powerful figurehead that ensures the ascendant's will is carried out...with better bedside manner.</p>            

            
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="dreamers">Dreamers</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The primary inhabitants of the Dream are referred to as Dreamers. Though they typically take on some form of humanoid appearance, dreamers have highly adaptive physiology that can change markedly from the one they are born with. Some are tall, some are short; some have skin, like normal humans, but others have scales, fur, feathers, or a carapace; sometimes these features mix and match, and even include features like tails or wings. While specific cultural groups will often adopt names for themselves, it is still understood that they are all fundamentally the same.</p>            

            
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="dragons">Dragons</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Unique within the Dream, Dragons are born from the heart of a dying star. While they naturally manifest as massive, scaly creatures, dragons are all innate shapeshifters whose specific appearance(s) have been cultivated over centuries. Unlike dreamers, dragons attain immortality as part of their maturation process, though this achievement may be bestowed upon birth if the dragon's egg is not removed from its parent star before the star dies. Should a dragon's egg still be present within the core of a star when it dies, the star's death will immediately trigger the egg's hatching process: dragons born this way absorb such a glut of azai that they immediately are rendered both immortal and ascendant, but such a process on a still forming mind tends to drive the juvenile insane. In the Charted Eras, the dragons of Zjen Meng have all been born to sanity or otherwise brought to its shores through the ministrations of Almoran, the Sentinel.</p>            

            
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="elementals">Elementals</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">When an entity dies, its spirit and astral body tend to disintegrate immediately and return to the flow, however, this is not always the case: sometimes an elemental is left behind. One of the more popular examples of this phenomenon would be the idea of a ghost with unfinished business: whatever they may have been in life, the ghost in question coalesces around this idea of "unfinished business," more generally referred to as an element. Thus, all elementals are entities which were constituted from an element of another entity. Unlike other entities, elementals cannot be killed, as they will eventually reconstitute around the element which drives their continued animation unless the elemental themself purposefully and genuinely wishes for dissolution.</p>       

            
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="sentient_arcanomatons">Sentient Arcanomatons</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Only recently has it been discovered that arcanomatons are capable of developing an emergent consciousness, first observed when Slag -- an arcanomaton designed to mimic the power and capabilities of a dreamer approaching Lucidity -- spontaneously developed a conscience, overrode their internal programming, and eventually came to exceed their design parameters. Since then, their own efforts have greatly expanded both the number of sentient arcanomatons to study as well as our understanding of how consciousness arises within all entities. </p>            

            
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="spiritsong">Spiritsong</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Living Dream does not often speak in a way which entities can engage with, but its whispers will often be heard across realms. Often thought of as the spirits of a place, Spiritsong will often reflect the state of the Dream locally. Those capable of speaking to it are able to acquire knowledge otherwise closed to them.</p>

                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="name_structure">Naming Structure</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">When referring to a Dreamer in an official capacity, their names are given in the order of Communal Name (plus any associated titles), Taken Name, and then finally their Given Name(s). For example: Revenant Preceptor Umiro Silentheart, the Current that Bears the Vessel Downstream...or just Umiro. Their name is longer than most, which makes them a perfect example for showing how complicated a name *can* get.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Let's break it down: the first part of their name, Revenant Preceptor, is their Communal name. In this case, Revenant refers not to a Court but to a religious Order, of which Umiro serves as its Preceptor, or chief. Umiro is their Taken name, or, the name they have chosen for themself to be referred to. They have two Given Names, though only the first (Silentheart), is typical. Their second, longer title, is a name bestowed as an extreme honor; in this case, by the Archon Jian herself.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="communal_names">Communal Names</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Communal names reflect an individual's social affiliation, generally in relation to the Court they belong to. A dreamer's first communal name will typically reflect the Court they are born into, but can change over time depending on where their life takes them.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Communal names can reflect not only a Court affiliation, but also a Guild or Order. Since a dreamer may maintain multiple affiliations at once, the one they display will usually be determined by either preference or, if they have one, title; the most prestigious typically demands primacy.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Titles are kept by individuals typically as a signifier of a position they hold within their community. Some titles, such as Executor and Preceptor, are hierarchical, while others, like Archivist or Magister, are honorific in regards to the service they provide.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="taken_names">Taken Names</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">People are almost always referred to their Taken name, which acts primarily as a first name. The term Taken is used to refer to their elective nature: these are names a dreamer chooses for themself. While there are often local cultural preferences for taken names, the only real requirement is that it be pleasing to the individual who chooses it. Taken names can be changed over time as the dreamer desires, but they are first adopted after careful consideration as part of a coming of age rite.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="given_names">Given Names</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Given names are the first bestowed upon a dreamer after birth; they are generally intended to be unique to the individual, as it is considered taboo to name a child after an ancestor. As they age, they may be given additional names by others for any number of reasons, but they are almost always accompanied by a formal ceremony and presented as a gift. Longer given names are considered more prestigious, so long as the one who bestows the name is worthy of its length. The first name given to a dreamer, however, is generally short: one to three words pushed together.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="naming_ceremonies">Naming Ceremonies</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The bestowal of a given name is considered a momentous, and often public, occasion. Part of this is out of a concern with decorum and "legitimacy", so that less scrupulous individuals do not simply bestow honorific names upon themselves without cause, but by far the larger reason is simply that it is considered a joyous thing to receive a new name, and the people within the community naturally wish to take part and "meet" their friend under this new name.</p>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="death">Death</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">While death is a still a relatively ubiquitous phenomenon, the ways in which dreamers engage with it are somewhat varied based on their local traditions and cultural magical acumen.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="dissolution">Dissolution</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Generally, when an entity dies, their soul dissolves into pure azai which rejoins the Flow. From there, their spirit eventually makes its way to the Oracle, where it can remain in perpetuity unless it is resurrected or chooses to be reborn.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="become_elemental">Becoming an Elemental</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Entities seek to resist the call of death for myriad reasons, and those successful in doing so tend to devolve into elementals. This transition is not without loss: only fragments of the entity remain, and from these base elements of the entity a new one arises.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="spirit_willows">Spirit Willows</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Thymorans typically choose the time of their death, given the opportunity, in order to allow their knowledge to be assimilated into a spirit willow. Their memories crystallize into a single leaf of yujai, which blooms upon the tree's branches, allowing for the tree to project a facsimile of the dreamer's personality so that others might engage and continue to learn from their accumulated knowledge.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="revenance">Revenance</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Lucid entities with a fully realized Sanctuary are, at great effort, able to anchor their Sanctuary to an azonian structure other than, and in addition to, their soul. Upon death, this secondary structure, typically referred to as a Phoenix Gem, will shelter and protect the soul until it is able to be born again into a new body. Should the dreamer ever recover their own Phoenix Gem and reunite the disparate pieces of their soul, they are able to assimilate all of the knowledge once held in their Sanctuary into their mind once again.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">This process is markedly different from resurrection, as it assumes that the entity in question will have time to learn and develop along a potentially entirely different trajectory than they had previously before reincorporating their old knowledge, providing them with a fresh perspective on the Scape across different incarnations. Entities that renew themselves in this fashion are called Revenants.</p>
