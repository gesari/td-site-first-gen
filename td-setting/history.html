            <h2 class="localHead">History of the Dream</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">The historical eras of the Dreamscape fall in one of two categories: Uncharted Eras(UE), and Charted Eras(CE). The Charted Eras begin with Fengara's awakening and continue from there, as no post-Celebrant society has yet been found to originate earlier, and generally account for all of recorded history. The Uncharted Eras are from a previous cycle of civilization which, though we have heard first-hand accounts of those times, are so far removed from now that almost no physical evidence remains to support the stories we have heard.</p> 

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="uncharted_history">Uncharted History</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">While we can verify the broad strokes of what happened in these times, thanks to the first-hand accounts collected from Almoran, Alteraph, and data recovered from Celebrant installations, the specifics are largely lost and beyond recovery.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="dragon_ascendancy">The Dragon Ascendancy</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A vast expanse of time drifting so far into antiquity we have no knowledge of what may have preceded it dominated by ascended dragons driven mad at birth who kept dreamers as pets, slaves, and tools. In the stories relayed to us directly by Alteraph and Almoran, and what more we have been able to piece together via Celebrant installations throughout the Dream, suggest that there were no mythos of a time before, but the sources are so fragmented that definitive proof is hardly in supply.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="celebrants_pact">The Celebrants of the Pact</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A group of dreamers eventually came together with dragons and phoenixes to unify under a single pact of revolution against the dragon ascendants. They fought for liberty and equitable relations among all children of the Dream, arguing they were all reflections of an identical source. As their power waned, the desperate dragons unleashed a dangerous force, the Nightmare: a semi-sentient vortex of such magnitude it could have sundered the Dreamscape and dispersed it into the vast infinity of the Interstice. Though they did eventually succeed, the Celebrants' ultimate victory was thwarted by Bronokh's betrayal of Alteraph.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="almorans_vigil">Almoran's Vigil</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">When the Celebrants' gambit to fully quell the Nightmare failed due to betrayal, Almoran was left alone to care for the dragons left to him on a world sundered by the fragments of Keshal which fell to the surface. Two of his charges -- Arselion and Fengara -- had already hatched and were placed into stasis, that the Sentinel might unbind their souls from the nexus that had forced both their insanity and ascension: they were to be rendered mortal and, more importantly, sane, that they might earn their ascension if and when they proved worthy. The rest were as yet unhatched, 25 eggs to be protected and kept until Almoran's work with Fengara and Arselion had completed, and hatched as part of the process of Renewal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="charted_eras">Charted Eras</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though we do not have specific dates for Almoran's Vigil - it seems the Sentinel lost track of time at some point during his duties, or simply stopped measuring it - Fengara's own archives within Kalen'toz have made it relatively easy to track time from when she was first freed through to the modern day. As such, the Charted Eras begin from her emancipation and continue through the present day.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="mothers_solitude">The Mother's Solitude | 1CE - 208 CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Trapped in a liminal state so long she almost lost her sense of self, Fengara was finally able to find a way to swap places with her captor. Her gambit caught Almoran unaware, trapping him in turn and affording Fengara the luxury of unbound freedom. She pillaged the Celebrant archives and, learning of Arselion's internment and that of the other dragon eggs, sought to turn them to her advantage. She fed off Arselion's own energies in an attempt to reverse the effects of Almoran's ministrations and became incredibly powerful as a result, but could not find a way to recreate her ascension.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="the_brood">The Brood | 208CE - 624CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">After she had completed her roost in Kalen'toz and sequestered all knowledge of the Celebrants and ascension within her personal archives, Fengara hatched the eggs that had been in Almoran's care and raised them as her own. Though she claimed to have produced their eggs herself, none of her children were ever able to procreate and produce more dragons, nor did the Broodmother herself ever yield more eggs. Naturally curious creatures, they spent much time seeking to learn more of the Dream and their place in it, that they might fill in the gaps in their mother's stories. </p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="kalas_renewal">Kala's Renewal | 624CE - 697CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">For their entire lives, Zjen Meng's largest satellite proved mysterious and alluring to the Brood. It had clearly shattered some time in the distant past, giving rise to the planet's many rings, but how part of it had remained whole and in a stable orbit, or what the source of its unique jade glow was, remained an unknown. Finally, some of the more curious members of the Brood figured how to venture there in person, and there they discovered the first sign of the Celebrants which Fengara had not hidden from their sight, including Mother Kala herself, still in stasis after all these years. </p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Kala taught them the truth of their origins and the history of their peoples, such as she understood it, much of which conflicted with the narrative Fengara had concocted to explain their presence on Zjen Meng. She explained the process of Renewal, the goal she had been put in stasis to enact with the Sentinel upon waking and the ultimate goal of the Celebrants: to repopulate the Dream with dreamers and dragons rebuilding side by side. Moved by her recollection, several dragons freely offered their aid despite Fengara's wishes.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though she successfully located other Celebrant installations with more of her kind in stasis, that she approached in the company of dragons rather than the Sentinel led them to reject Kala's call for Renewal and return to their slumber. In the end, Kala enacted the ritual of Renewal alone. She gave of her own life to ensure that dreamer populace could be reborn, a sacrifice which earned her the honorific title of Mother. </p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="two_matriarchs">The Time of Two Matriarchs | 697CE - 973CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Mother Kala barely lived to see the second generation of dreamers born before she rejoined the Flow. The process of Renewal was never meant to be a singular effort, and it took a heavy toll on her. Shortly after her death, Fengara confiscated or destroyed most of Kala's remaining apparatus in an attempt to bury the Celebrants' knowledge, creating the first real factional schism between both dragons and dreamers. The Broodmother argued that Kala's vision of unity between the entities of the Dream, while admirable for its convictions, was ultimately flawed if only because the dragons, ostensibly eternal, would always have more wisdom to impart to dreamers than the other way around.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though none of her children shared her belief in draconic superiority, not all of them were willing to actively oppose her either. Likewise, though most dreamers cleaved to the ideals espoused by Mother Kala, there were still a significant amount who found merit in Fengara's argument and willingly submitted themselves. Over time, Fengara's demands for submission became more aggressive, and conflict broke out. This culminated in a vortex on the island of Yan'sho which would have destroyed what left of Keshal had Yu-Lan not been able to quell it. That she did so by herself, in the presence of several dragons whose combined efforts had just failed, effectively ended the conflict: the shame of having nearly destroyed their home tempered by the proof that a dreamer could wield magics more potent than a dragon.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">In place of devotion to a figurehead, the dragon sage Oroxys offered a philosophy born of the natural world: the Harmonic Path. Its treatises stressed equality between things, and the importance of maintaining proper relationships with oneself, others, and the world itself. A relatively simple framework, its impact on Thymoran culture is both enduring and impossible to overstate. To supplement and exemplify Oroxys' teachings, his sister Gujen sculpted Hollow Stone, the first arcology, on the shores of Meridian Lake as a neutral meeting ground for all. </p>

                <p class="sectionBody">After finding common ground, the dreamers of Keshal and dragons of Zjen Meng were unified by the combined efforts of Verin and Azyra. Building on the tradition of Meridian Lake as a sanctified meeting ground for dreamers and dragons alike, Verin manifested the Emerald Roost on its northern shores with a single spell, and gifted the dragons an arcology of their own. Ringed by her expectant children, Fengara was all but forced to accept the gesture: the disparate realms of Keshal and Zjen Meng became the unified system, Thymora. Later, Rune Clasp completed the Triad, an arcology built by and for dragons and dreamers alike. The end of this era saw the Jade Monolith of Keshal begin its transformation into Verin'kar: a sacred site of unified vision to serve as the capital of Thymora. With the aurion excavated from the monolith's heart the Thymorans were also able to begin work on the Host of Styga, which would create for the first time a stable bridge to the Oracle, the ever-shifting dimension of possibilities.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">Inspired by the tales of Senzo, Calaras, and other explorers who had traversed Heaven's Eye, Aren-Ko sets out to establish an international community with Verin'kar at its heart. In the course of his travels to many dozens of realms he organized the efforts to create a comprehensively charted map of the Heavenly Threads, the connections between Heaven's Eye in different systems, and made lasting friendships along the way, laying the foundations for Thymora to serve as the home of an interstellar community.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">This time period oversaw most of the accomplishments Thymoran society is famous for and reliant upon: the completion of Verin'kar and Styga upon Keshal; the establishment of the Gate Network; the construction of, and universal access to, Sho'ken, the Oracle Archives. For these reasons and more, Thymora met with near-boundless success. Thanks to the relatively unassailable power of the Seat of Dreams and a historical willingness for Archons to admit fault and accept accountability for their missteps, systemic issues were maintained at manageable levels or avoided entirely, and the Archonate entered an age of widespread post-scarcity.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="grey_tide">The Grey Tide | 2721CE - 3030CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Ringrealm, an artificial realm so named for forming a ring around its star's equitorial band, had long been known to its inhabitants as a place rife with ancient installations. Evidence suggests the realm, and all the installations found within, had been built by an ancient dragon ascendant to safeguard its wealth; these places were often locked, and always dangerous. To date, however, none have held anything so dangerous as the arishaz: a group of scaled, serpentine dreamers discovered in stasis. When freed, they demanded to speak to Ringrealm's dragon overlord, a request which uncharacteristically resulted in the appearance of Fengara herself. The arishaz, however, received the Ruby Broodmother with disdain, and soon fled their would-be captors, teleporting to an unknown destination. They returned within decades, having multiplied rapidly and ready for interstellar conquest.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">When first it arrived, none could stand against the Grey Tide. Having never focused strongly on military conquest, the best Thymora could do was hunker down in self-defense. It took more than three centuries to reimagine themselves as warriors rather than just defenders, but the Tide was finally quelled by the Archon Shorei and her protege, Kuang. Though victory was achieved, barely one in ten dreamers had managed to survive the arishaz, almost exclusively Thymorans.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="reclamation">The Reclamation | 3030CE - 3276CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Shorei and Kuang began the process of demilitarization once the threat to Thymora had passed, looking towards the future of rebuilding and reclaiming what was lost. This was not to be the end of strife, however: first Kuang was betrayed by Fengara, then Ahr-Deth was betrayed by the Chorus, a cabal of minsters who had come to power during the fight against the Tide sought to hold on to it at any cost. They had grown accustomed to ruling by force, and felt that Yzet's course-correction, as well as Raikos' subsequent reforms, had been in error and left the Archonate exposed to the dangers of the Tide at its inception; an unacceptable mistake which they argued Ahr-Deth and Jian sought to repeat.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="ostracism">The Ostracism | 3276CE - 3534CE</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The machinations of the Chorus resulted in the sequestration of the Archon Ahr-Deth, the Mandati, Jian, and the Dragon Chancellor, Kisono, but their success ended there. Ahr-Deth's will could not be subverted by their gambit; they had greatly underestimated the archon, and his resistance to being bound unwillingly set off a chain reaction for which his assailants had no contingency plan. The Gate Network, whose heart was so close to where Ahr-Deth was bound, and whose paths had been utilized by the Chorus to bind Jian on Antaris, collapsed in a violent fashion, unleashing devastating results at all open points of the network as it did so. It proved particularly harmful to Lucid dreamers, many of whom died of azaian asphyxiation regardless of proximity and without being able to preserve their knowledge via spirit willow. The same disruption that killed the Awakened also caused the withering of many enchantments once thought permanent; even access to Sho'ken, and thus all the accumulated knowledge of their ancestors, was lost. The disparate realms of Thymora, still attempting to rebuild in the wake of Dream-wide devastation wrought by the Tide, were crippled once again.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">After centuries of effort, Jian was able to reach out to champions upon the realm of Antaris to come to her aid. They returned to Keshal, freed the Archon, Ahr-Deth, and presided over Jian's own ascension. **The success or failure of Jian's champions will determine how the rest of this section is filled out**</p>
