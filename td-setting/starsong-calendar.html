            <h2 class="localHead">Azaian Fluctuations</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">The realms of the Dream are all witness to the same fluctuations within the Azaian Flow, which cycles at a predictable rate throughout the Dream's entirety. The reliability of this phenomenon, as well as the wonder it inspires, has served as the foundation for the calendar of every known civilization encounted by Thymora. Though days progress differently on different realms, the standard of the Thymoran calendar has been easily adopted.</p> 

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="starsong_cycle">The Starsong Cycle</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Based off the regular fluctuations of the azaian flow, the Starsong calendar has been adopted for its uniform application to all realms. It has a standard 360-day year, broken up into 12 months of 30 days.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The calendar is organized around the transition of the stellar seasons, which corresponds to the fluctuations in the Flow. New Years begin with the festival of Dawntide. Each season lasts for three months, and their heights and transitions are all marked with regular festivals.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="seasons">Seasons</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">While each realm has its own climate and orbital period, which may or may not correspond directly to the Starsong calendar, the seasons of the Dream are governed by the regular expansion and contraction of the currents of the azaian Flow. Depending on the stellar season, different types of magical "weather" phenomena are common: storms of azai, spontaneous eruptions of force, cyclones of energy, or even the rapid crystallization of azonian structures from seemingly nothing. While potentially destructive, these phenomena are often regarded with wonder and awe.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="Heavensflood">Heavensflood | Months 1 - 3</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The period of growth which begins the year. Stars begin to awaken, and begin to glow brighter as they do; the currents of the Flow visibly accelerate. Lightsqualls -- azaian "thunderstorms" characterized by violent bursts of prismatic light -- are common this time of year.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="brightsky">Brightsky | Months 4 - 6</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The period of stellar action and energy, when azai levels peak. Rituals requiring extraordinary effect are planned to be performed this time of year if possible. It is often associated with Burstfires: magical flames that burst forth from azonian structures that have become glutted with azaian energies.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="lightebb">Lightebb | Months 7 - 9</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Period of harvests and celebration. The work of the year begins to wind down ahead of cyclone season: these naturally ocurring vortices sustain themselves on the buildup of latent azai, all too common within the atmosphere of planetary realms.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="starnight">Starnight | Months 10 - 12</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Period of rest. Azai converts more easily to azon, but azonian structures become more brittle, suffused with less azai than is ideal. Though dreamers typically do minimal work this time of year, it is an ideal time for beginners to learn how to form spell architectures. It is beloved for the beauty of its Colorpours; magical blizzards which occur even on realms that do not experience snow, they are caused when latent azai becomes sluggish enough to crystallize into brittle azonian structures. These colorful crystals have a crunchy texture when grasped, but they quickly disperse into nothingness with a flash of light if clutched too tightly: a phenomenon beloved by all.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="months">Months</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Months are not given names in Thymora, simply numbers, in relation to its position within a season, or the year itself. For example, the fourth month of the year is also the first month of Brightsky; the eighth month of the year is also the second month of Lightebb; the twelfth month of the year is also the third month of Starnight. Months may be referred to with either numeration. More metropolitan areas tend to refer to months by their position in the year, wheras more remote and/or pastoral locations will number their months relative to the current season.</p>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="festivals">Festivals</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Thymorans are avid fans of communal revelry, so they tend to organize their calendars around festivals. There are eight festivals dedicated to the seasons, at time in which they transition as well as their midpoint, and then many other cultural ones besides. While there may be variance in terms of cultural festivals between realms, the eight seasonal holidays are generally ubiquitous. </p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Festivals always begin in the late afternoon, as they are primarily thought of as an overnight affair. A popular form of festival preparation involves a large banquet-sized breakfast, followed by late morning and early afternoon relaxation before the festivities begin. Similarly, festivals tend to end at the same time which they begin, the early afternoon, giving celebrants an opportunity to unwind with a final communal repast before retiring.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="dawntide">Dawntide | 25/12 - 6/1</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="lightswell">Lightswell | 28/3 - 3/4</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">This festival is held in celebration of the season of Brightsky and the Flow's peak.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="lifescrest">Lifescrest | 13/5 - 18/5</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A carnal festival celebrating Brightsky's plenty.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="dusktide">Dusktide | 28/6 - 3/7</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The festival of alms, honoring the dwindling of the Flow and thanks for its bounty.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="twilit_bounty">Twilit Bounty | 13/8 - 18/8</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The final harvests of Lightebb culminate in this festival, which celebrates an end to the year's ambitions.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="nightfall">Nightfall | 28/9 - 3/10</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">This festival, held at the beginning of Starnight, honors the dead and venerated ancestors.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="midnight">Midnight | 13/11 - 18/11</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The festival of introspection falls in the deepest part of Starnight.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="tidesturn">Tidesturn | 4/12 - 9-12</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Perhaps the most beloved, if solemn, festival of the year. Tidesturn celebrates the defeat of the Grey Tide and mourns all those who could not be saved.</p>
