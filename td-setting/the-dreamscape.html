        <div class="localContent">
            <!-- Page Content -->
            <h2 class="localHead">Dimensions</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">The Dreamscape is comprised of three interconnected and interdependent dimensions: the Dream, the Oracle, and the Reliquary. It is understood that the three dimensions are, in a very real sense, manifested by the circulation of the deepest Flow currents from within the Interstice, and maintain their equilibrium so long as the flow of azai remains balanced between them. </p> 

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="the_oracle">The Oracle</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Everything that has ever existed, or may have come to exist, has its reflection of the Oracle. Its ever-shifting landscape is incredibly volatile and dangerous to dreamers who venture here, but those who have done so and returned all report experiences that proved incredibly insightful, if dangerous. It is a commonly held belief that the dimension has a will of its own, and uses its landscape as a form of communication.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Flow tends to channel azai from the Oracle into the Dream, where it takes on more static forms for a time.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="shoken">Sho'ken</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Oracle Archives are the one known stable area within the Oracle: a complex of truly massive scale, meant to house the breadth of Thymoran knowledge in a location that was uniquely accessible to anyone, from anywhere. Though precious few Realms these days support a working Host -- an artificial Nexus maintained to tether the realm directly to Sho'ken -- those that do reap the benefit of more than a millenia's worth of knowledge available directly via their unitool.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="the_dream">The Dream</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">The physical realm where most living entities arise and reside is referred to as the Dream. Its stability is a carefully cultivated phenomena maintained by the sentient stars that cultivate the harmonious Flow through all three dimensions. As the static azonian forms of the Dream begin to decay and dissolve, the Flow directs them through the Reliquary and back to the Oracle.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Within the Dream, a Realm is a catch-all term that often refers to inhabited planetary bodies, but is expansive enough to denote any semi-permanent body currently supporting life. As such, relay Stations, such as those often built outside Heaven's Eye, and Planes, orbital platforms built for the purpose of observation and study around stellar phenomena such as black holes, also fall into the category of a Realm. A System is a collection of Realms and other bodies that all fall within the gravity well of a star, and Sectors are large collections of Systems that maintain some macrocosmic cohesion: the Starry Veil is perhaps the easiest Sector to define, as it includes all Sectors which lie within the nebula that bears its name.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">There are countless stellar systems of the dream, each with a collection of realms. Though relatively rare, a collection of realms are capable of supporting life, many of which are populated with dreamers of various shapes and sizes. Most of the known realms charted by Thymoran explorers are in the vicinity of Heaven's Eye outlets, though forays into the Deep Dream have met with dreamers on realms unconnected to the greater currents of the Flow.</p>

                <p class="sectionHead" id="solitary_path">The Solitary Path</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though the size of this sector is rather expansive, it is unique for having an incredible dearth of Heaven's Eye outlets. While many stars have been observed within the Path, not many have been explored, since each system at either end -- Thymora and Katahven -- have many connections to realms outside this ssector.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="thymora">The Thymora System</p>
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="zjen_meng">Zjen Meng</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The home of dragons, Zjen Meng was the place where Fengara was interred for eons before emerging and hatching her brood. From here, the dragons have sought to chart the course of civilization since before Thymora even existed.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="keshal">Keshal</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The lone satellite of Zjen Meng is a shattered husk of itself, yet Keshal is held together and rendered habitable by the same thing that rent it asunder: Verin'kar, the Jade Tower. An aurion monolith taller than mountains, it has been sculpted into the capitol of Thymora. Though it was betrayed from within, an Archon once again sits upon the Seat of Dreams and casts her gaze towards Heaven's Eye.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="prism_station">Prism Station</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A relay station for the Gate Network, Prism Station is populated by dreamers stranded there during the teleportation system's collapse. They have spent much of the last three centuries struggling against the Chorus, who continually abducted their community members for their own experiments. The station was liberated from Chorus control by the Revenant Order and is once again governed by its inhabitants, which now includes a sentient Arbiter VI.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="katahven">The Katahven System</p>
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="selyn_toz">Selyn'toz</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A realm upon which Thymora ever only held a single arcology in the form of an embassy, Selyn'toz was already inhabited when they discovered it by a mysterious group of dreamers who refer to themselves as the Selyn'ba. Though not much is known about them, their devotion to their mistress, Selyn, is absolute and apparent in every facet of their culture. Their tolerance of Thymorans was only ever cursory at best: they accepted that it was a necessity, since their Heaven's Eye proved a chokepoint for many different avenues of travel, but generally prefer to be left alone. After the Ostracism and the gate network's collapse, the remaining thymorans on Selyn'toz fractured: while some continued to respect the wishes of the native Selyn'ba and kept to themselves in Serai Seraph, others chose to try and claim the realm for themselves and have been struggling against the Selyn'ba ever since.</p>

                <p class="sectionHead" id="starry_veil">The Starry Veil</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">So named for the nebula which sets its boundaries, the Starry Veil borders the Solitary Path on the Thymora side. Its many inhabitable worlds were found relatively dormant by the first wave of Thymoran explorers, though now they are among the most populous and advanced within the Archonate.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="vollok">The Vollok System</p>
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="antaris">Antaris</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Antaris was uninhabited by dreamers when it was first discovered, populated instead by various examples of megafauna believed to be a continuation of those that existed in uncharted eras, and its unspoiled natural vistas have led the realm to become something of a spiritual symbol for Thymorans: as a culture so tied to the knowledge and wisdom of their ancestors, a world which looks much the way Mother Kala would remember it is a rare treasure. There are several arcologies seeded around the world, most of which were built with the intent of being places of archaeological study and/or personal cultivation.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="veilhem">Veilhem</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though still counted as within the Starry Veil, Veilhem sits well outside the reach of the Gate network; for most ships, it is a ten day voyage to Antaris and the nearest Heaven's Eye relay. Originally discovered and used as a place for a supply caches and ship repairs by Calaras and Senzo, it has since become a frontier realm for treasure hunters looking for hidden signs of Uncharted Era civilizations and those simply seeking a quiet life alike.</p>

                <p class="sectionHead" id="ancients_table">The Ancient's Table</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A remote sector at the bounds of the known Dream, the Ancient's Table derives its name from the many wonders of uncharted time that have been discovered there.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="ars_ora">The Ars'ora System</p>
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="ringrealm">Ringrealm</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">An artificial realm created by the dragon ascendants from Uncharted time to store their monumental wealth, Ringrealm is so named because it forms a perfect ring which completely encircles its star along its plane of orbit. Ringrealm is infamous for being the place where arishaz were first discovered; though it was not the home of the Grey Tide, the fact that it is the place from where they escaped containment has led the dreamers who live here to adopt an attitude of cataloguing and containing the things they find without interacting with them. To those still here, the understanding and maintenance of the ancient safeguards in this space is a sacred charge.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="outer_planes">The Outer Planes</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Far from any Heaven's Eye outlet lies a magically bound singularity, around which a collection of observation stations have been built. So named for their relatively planar and sprawling construction, the Outer Planes are a collection of continent-sized orbital platforms built to enable long-term self sufficient study of both the singularity itself and the magic that binds it.</p>

                <p class="sectionHead" id="deep_dream">The Deep Dream</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The reaches of space unexplored by Thymora are referred to as the Deep Dream. </p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="foundhaven">Foundhaven</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">A realm in a star system without Heaven's Eye, Foundhaven is presided over by a council of lucid Thymoran defectors who have set themselves up as a deistic pantheon that rules the realm. They are mostly benevolent and magnanimous, barring the few who serve as dramatic antagonists: their elaborate charade serving as a means for keeping the populace distracted and uninterested in looking to the stars beyond.</p>

                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="the_reliquary">The Reliquary</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">A unique dimension in that it's outer boundaries are almost always visible, the Reliquary is forever illuminated in the oily-tinted light of the Dark Star: a living prison for eldritch entities from the Scape's uncharted eras. Like preserved fossils, artifacts and buildings from ancient civilizations still standing have found themselves here; things are not always fully dissolved in their transition from the Dream back to the Oracle. The Reliquary acts as a filter for these things, and is best known for its most popular inhabitants: elementals, the remnants of living entities who died but have not fully passed on.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="dark_star">Dark Star Terminus</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Though its own volume serves as the prison for its charges, the Dark Star itself is fully encapsulated in a manner akin to a dyson sphere, the interior terrain of which is referred to as the Terminus and serves as the entire expanse of the Reliquary. Though it appears finite, no known maps of its entirety exist except in the vaguest of senses. Even Omnox and Volar -- the two ascendants who presume to preside over the dimension -- claim not to have full knowledge of its layout, though whether their assertions are genuine is another matter.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">Though it is a place to which dreamers have traveled, the Interstice is not thought of as a dimension in the traditional sense. Rather, it is the stage upon which the other three dimensions are set; the space between them that binds the three together. Objects and devices which make use of interdimensional space (e.g. a bag that is larger on the inside than it appears on the outside) typically do so by making use of the Interstice's unique properties.</p>
