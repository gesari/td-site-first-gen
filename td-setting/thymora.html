            <h2 class="localHead">Thymora</h2>
            <p class="localHeadBody">Thymora is a federation of courts across many realms and star systems of the Dreamscape, promoting secure and equitable relations among its members. Thanks to a permissive democratic structure, robust trade and transit networks, and a stable central authority, it has met with remarkable success. As the sole civilization capable of surviving and defeating the Grey Tide, Thymorans proved their martial acumen many times over. Even so, the Archonate has refrained from creating long-term enemies via aggression, affording them a respectable reputation even among those courts who retain their sovereignty. From planetary realms, to space stations maintaining stable paths through wormholes, realms manufactured wholecloth by unknown progenitors, or orbital platforms surveying mysterious interstellar phenomena, there are few places among the known Dream that have not been charted or protected by Thymora. </p>
            
            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="archonate">The Archonate</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">Referred to as the Somnial Court within the structure of Thymora itself, the Archonate is the formal term given to the central Court of Thymora. It is headed either by the Archon or, if an heir has been chosen, the Mandati. It is unique among the Courts of Thymora in many ways, all to the purpose of engineering a centralized authority that is representative of the entire Legion.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Unlike other Courts, whose Councils are elected by the body's already-elected proxies and preceptors, the Archon's court allows each realm of constituents to send councilors of their own choosing as part of their delegation to the Jade Tower. Also, while not a strict requirement, the Chancellor of the Somnial Court has always been a dragon as a token of respect.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="legion">The Legion</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">All Thymoran citizens are considered members of the Legion, regardless of their current standing with any individual Court, Guild, or Order. Members of the Legion are accorded equitable treatment no matter where they travel within the Archonate, including equal access to all public services (e.g. food, shelter, education).</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="arcologies">Arcologies</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Dreamer settlements and cities are often relatively contained and self-sufficient, generally residing within a single massive structure designed to emerge seamlessly from the surrounding environment: an arcology. Blending local ecology seamlessly into traditional cityscapes, arcologies manifest in various shapes and sizes to create a single structure capable of housing all its residents in a relatively small footprint. This ensures that dreamers are all in close enough proximity to each other to ensure maximum community support for individuals and that the surrounding ecosystem remains intact without the threat of encroaching urban sprawl.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="gate_network">The Gate Network</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Built around the phenomena of Heaven's Eyes -- wormholes connecting disparate star systems -- the Thymoran Gate Network is a series of interconnected teleporters which grants near instant access to any place connected to it. The Network's central hub is within the Jade Tower itself, supported by Relay Stations at each outlet of Heaven's Eye through which it passes. Though many of the relay stations are currently inoperable, the infrastructure with which to recreate the interstellar roads of the Dream still exist in most systems where the Network once operated.</p>

                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="harmonic_path">The Harmonic Path</h4>

                <!-- Harmonic Scales, Verse 1-->
                <p class="exampleTextMid">Lucidity reveals the secrets of the azonai,</p>
                <p class="exampleTextMid">that fundament from which all arises,</p>
                <p class="exampleTextMid">which leads the Awakened to a vision of unity</p>
                <p class="exampleTextMid">and necessitates harmony.</p>
                <p class="exampleTextMid">This is the path.</p>
                <p class="exampleText"> - Harmonic Scales, verse 1</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">This Thymoran philosophy was first laid out by the dragon sage, Oroxys, shortly after proving the existence of a soul and its connection to the azonai: the ultimate source of all. It promotes the use of mindfulness to see things as they truly are -- varying manifestations of the same essential source -- in order to find the best way to navigate life's challenges. It is a philosophical framework that asserts all things within the Dream arise from the same source, and that this truth should awaken in others a kinship with all other facets of the Dream. The philosophy encourages entities to live in harmony with the Dream around them, stressing adherence to the three virtues: compassion, consideration, and humility. Spiritual rather than religious, the Harmonic Path was also meant to counter Fengara's rising influence as a being worthy of worship and simply reframe her, and everything else, as varied reflections of the same essential thing. </p>
                <p class="sectionBody">To say it was effective would be an understatement: the Harmonic Path has assimilated into every culture in which it has come into contact. Though it countered Fengara's aspirations in Thymora, it has in other places admirably coexisted with other religions and objects of devotion. Oroxys' original treatise, Harmonic Scales, is the most prolific text ever published, and the most often sought within Sho'ken's archives.</p>

                <p class="sectionBody">It was adapted by Zohana into a political philosophy, which Zanele effectively implemented during her tenure as Executor of Hollow Stone. Buoyed by their example, Verin and Azyra used it to serve as the foundation for Thymora, which was not meant to govern individual courts directly but rather to promote a harmonious framework within which all could interact for mutual benefit.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">When asked why the Somnial Court would not govern the disparate courts of Thymora directly, Verin cited the wisdom of Oroxys and others as offered by the Harmonic Path: rules of conduct and systems of justice could never fully take the place of ideas such as kindness or virtue, these things must be realized rather than thrust upon a mind. The legal code courts were required to adopt were relatively lightweight, and primarily concerned membership within the Legion and commercial regulation; beyond that, the Legion of each Court is capable of determining its own need for rules and justice. Thymora's goal was not to prescribe these things, but rather to lead by example that they become unnecessary.</p>

                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="organizations">Organizations</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">There are many different organizations within Thymora, but they generally fall into one of three categories: Courts, Guilds, and Orders. </p>

                <!-- Courts -->
                <p class="sectionHead" id="courts">Courts</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Courts are the basic geopolitical unit of the Dreamscape. They are responsible both for administering to all dreamers within their domain and ensuring harmony is promoted between the local dreamers and the surrounding environments. They are generally responsible for, and administer from, the arcologies which house and provide for the self-sufficiency of their communities.</p>

                <p class="sectionHead" id="departments_ministries">Departments and Ministries</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Courts of the Dream generally adhere to the template of three departments and six ministries, but the bureaus that operate within each of them are specifically tailored to suit the unique situation of the local community.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="three_departments">The Three Departments</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Legionary Council, an elected body responsible for drafting laws.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Chancellery, responsible for the Court's archival apparatus and advising the other branches based on historical and present circumstances.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Court Affairs, which oversees the six ministries responsible for enacting the laws set forth by the Legionary Council, and administering to its populace, arcology, and greater geographic region.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="six_ministries">The Six Ministries</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ministry of Legions cares for the local populace, seeing to their needs and educational training.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ministry of Archives manages budgetary, commercial, and material concerns.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ministry of Rites interfaces with all local businesses and organizations that operate within the Court's bounds, such as Guilds or Orders with local chapters, the Censorate, or local freelancers.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ministry of Wards acts as a defense force that ensures the safety of the populace.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ministry of Harmony administers the judicial and rehabilitation systems.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">The Ministry of Works maintains the living arcologies and all other parts of civilian infrastructure.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="academies">Academies</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Education is considered compulsory by the Legion and as such it is up to the local Courts to administer it. This is generally managed by an Academy sponsored by the Ministry of Legions. Most every Academy is comprised of ten institutions: nine Colleges devoted to the nine aspects of azaian magic, and a generalist School of Style.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Junior students are first admitted to the School of Style, where they develop the fundamentals of wielding their foci and manifesting spell architectures. Once they have sufficiently advanced, they are allowed to test into one of the nine Colleges, where they develop a specialization as part of their studies. Specializations have ten levels of advancement, which are often used as minimum requirements to be nominated for positions within organizational structures. Progression through the ten levels is a lifelong pursuit, though most rarely progress beyond the third.</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Official progression from the School to one of the Colleges, and certification of Specialization enhancement, is managed by an Academy's Examination Board: a collection of faculty members associated with each College that evaluate a candidate's worthiness. While the examinations associated with the graduation from the School of Style and the achievement of of a Specialization's first level are the two most formal, all examinations are crucial for one's standing in Thymoran society: every Court, Guild, and Order references the Legion's academic records when evaluating candidates for admittance and advancement.</p>
            
                <!-- Guilds -->
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="guilds">Guilds</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">While Courts can see to many needs, they do not account for everything, nor are they meant to.  For all other aspects of social culture, there are Guilds. Whether they represent mercantile interests, crafters, artistic collectives, academic societies, troupes of performers, explorers, or anything else, Guilds are established organizations that unite people towards a common cause that is not necessarily local. Most Guilds operate among several Courts, pooling the resources and efforts of dreamers across entire realms and sometimes even worlds beyond their own towards some end of symbiotic advancement and achievement.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="censorate">The Arcanosmiths</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Popularized by the advent of arcanomatons, Arcanosmiths delve into the mysteries of the entire field of arcanetics. While the topic of sentient beings created from inanimate objects is surely their most sensational development, the advent of personal enhancements such as sigils and prosthetic limbs are considered achievements of the highest merit by those whose lives have been restored by such supplements.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="astral_navigators">The Astral Navigators</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Thymora's reach has been only partially attributed to its virtuous rule and strong central authority: without travelers to map the stars and establish relationships and trade between realms, where else would they have gone? While expansion is not an espoused virtue of the Somnial Court, the accumulation of knowledge is, especially that which concerns the state of the Dream itself. </p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="aurion_sculptors">The Aurion Sculptors</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Perhaps the most valuable substance in all the Dream, the cultivation, harvest, and distribution of aurion is a highly regulated trade. The Guild of Sculptors manages these process on behalf of the Legion as an impartial conductor of businesses between Courts, and also instructs dreamers in techniques for its manipulation and enchantment. </p>

                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="silver_sigil">The Silver Sigil</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">While aurion cannot be exactly reproduced via transmutation, the resultant onai is an adequate facsimile, and far more accessible. Its manipulation and enchantment follows similar physical rules as aurion, but its potency is not always consistent, and thus very dependent on the skill of the transmuter creating it. All phenomena may be converted into an onaian counterpart: an artform perfected by the Sigil which has enabled the widespread proliferation of enchanted talismans and magical technology throughout all social strata.</p>
            
                <!-- Orders -->
                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="orders">Orders</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Focused as they are on the wonders of everyday life, Thymorans are not particularly religious. Yet for the things that matter they have a strong sense of the sacred, and of devotion. Orders are devoted to sacred duties: disciples of the Archon, defenders of the Legion, facilitators of balance between dimensions, and more.</p>
            
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="censorate">The Censorate</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Of all the Orders recognized by the Somnial Court, none are so ubiquitous or beloved as the Censorate. Operating outside the normal jurisdiction of the Courts in which they operate, Censors are uniquely empowered to audit a Court's activity in order to prevent the spread of corruption and ensure the safety of the Legion. Generally portrayed in a very positive light, Censors are viewed as guardians of the people and the custodians of the meritocracy.</p>
            
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="renewal_guard">The Renewal Guard</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">An ancient group of Celebrants left in subterranean stasis installations, they were meant to emerge with the conclusion of the Sentinel's duties and assist Kala in the process of Renewal. They remained sequestered for millenia after Kala's emergence, however, at the behest of their leader, Bronokh: a betrayer who sought ultimate power for himself at the expense of his people. Recently, however, Almoran and his Revenant companions were able to uncover Bronokh's machinations and restore the Guard to its original purpose: guardianship and enforcement of a Pact between ascendants from all three dimensions of the Dreamscape to promote harmony and balance and prevent the return of Nightmare.</p>
            
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="revenant_order">The Revenant Order</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Originally founded by the Archon Jian in the years before becoming the Mandati, the Revenants are an order of dreamers who have achieved a means of transmitting their knowledge and memories between incarnations. Since her ascension, the Revenant Order has become the arm of the Archon: agents capable of speaking with her voice and carrying out her will. Their fame has only increased since the Ostracism, especially amongst the populace of Keshal and Zjen Meng, many of whom were liberated by their direct efforts.</p>
            
                <p class="sectionSubHead" id="obsidian_conclave">The Obsidian Conclave</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Once remnants of Fengara's original dreamer worshippers from before the Unification, the Obsidian Conclave lost faith in the Broodmother after her betrayal of the Archon Kuang and subsequent disappearance from Zjen Meng. In her absence, her archives were tabulated by her followers, who eventually discovered the existence of Arselion, whose siphoned essence had for millenia served as the basis of her enhanced potency. This truth led them to abandon Fengara's teaching and seek freedom for Arselion, who has again refocused their efforts towards custodianship of both Bastion and Kalen'toz as sites of cultural heritage for all Thymorans.</p>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h4 class="sectionHead" id="org_standings">Organizational Standings</h4>
                <p class="sectionBody">While the Harmonic Path eschews the establishment of disparate social claseses within the Legion, hierarchies still have their places within the structure of Thymoran organizations. Though the specific needs of individiual Courts and other organizations necessitate adaptation, members of Thymoran organizations will always fall into one of two positions: electors, and electeds. Electors make up, by far, the body of any organization as the rank and file. Leaders in any capacity fall into the Elected category, so named because only those respected by their peers may be chosen from among them to serve. Regardless of their position, no rank within an organization qualifies an individual for a higher standing within the Legion, though Electors within many organizations will vote to provide those they elect with additional perks as a sign of appreciation as a show of thanks for agreeing to take on the additional responsibilities inherent within their role.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="agents">Agents</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Generalists in an organizational structure would fall under the category of an Agent: most Thymorans fall into this category. The generalist role is the first step any organizational member occupies as they become acquainted with their responsibilities and the organization's overall function, usually the last stop for aged dreamers who seek less responsibility to the group but still maintain their presence, and it is also not uncommon for most dreamers to remain in this position for the flexibility it affords them in the rest of their lives.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="specialists">Specialists</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Natural talent is given little credence in Thymora. It is believed that with proper training and dedication, anyone may learn any skill available to them, and though it is known that not everyone cares for such rigorous practice, those who do are actively encouraged to do so. Most PCs fall into this category, or will as their studies advance.</p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="proxies">Proxies</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Organizations generally have multiple specialist groups. For instance, the Chancellery's Oracle Bureau oversees the acquisition, recording, and preservation of all recorded knowledge, and so they have specialists to match. Watchers observe and record events as they happen, Transcribers edit the Watchers' reports into a format suitable for preservation in the archives, Cataloguers take the finished media of the Transcribers and classify it accordingly for storage within the archives, and Archivists maintain the body of knowledge itself as well as assisting others with accessing it. Each of these specialist fields make up a vital part of the entire Bureau, and from each field a single specialist is chosen by their peers to act as a Proxy to guide their collective efforts and represent their point of view in decision-making processes. </p>

                <p class="sectionHeadSm" id="preceptors">Preceptors</p>
                <p class="sectionBody">Together with the various proxies, Preceptors form the head of a council that make the decisions governing the organization. Some Preceptors are appointed from without, some are elevated from within the ranks of the organization, but all must be ratified by those they would lead. Though Preceptors may often have the final authority on any decision made within the group, they are always viewed at most as first among equals.</p>
